a wide-range of genomics analysis tasks.  The most widely-used tools enable
genome arithmetic: that is, set theory on the genome.  For example, bedtools
allows one to intersect, merge, count, complement, and shuffle genomic
intervals from multiple files in widely-used genomic file formats such as BAM,
BED, GFF/GTF, VCF.")
