    (description
     "SWIG is an interface compiler that connects programs written in C and
C++ with languages such as Perl, Python, Ruby, Scheme, and Tcl.  It works by
taking the declarations found in C/C++ header files and using them to generate
the wrapper code that scripting languages need to access the underlying C/C++
code.  In addition, SWIG provides a variety of customization features that let
you tailor the wrapping process to suit your application.")
