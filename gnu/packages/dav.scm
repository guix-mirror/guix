platforms.  Calendars and address books are available for both local and remote
access, possibly limited through authentication policies.  They can be viewed
and edited by calendar and contact clients on mobile phones or computers.

Radicale intentionally does not fully comply with the CalDAV and CardDAV RFCs.
Instead, it supports the CalDAV and CardDAV implementations of popular
clients.")
