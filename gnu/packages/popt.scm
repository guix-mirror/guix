     "Argtable is an ANSI C library for parsing GNU style command line
options.  It enables a program's command line syntax to be defined in the
source code as an array of argtable structs.  The command line is then parsed
according to that specification and the resulting values are returned in those
same structs where they are accessible to the main program.  Both tagged (-v,
--verbose, --foo=bar) and untagged arguments are supported, as are multiple
instances of each argument.  Syntax error handling is automatic and the library
also provides the means for generating a textual description of the command
line syntax.")

similar to getopt(3), it contains a number of enhancements, including:

  - popt is fully reentrant;

  - popt can parse arbitrary argv[] style arrays while getopt(3) makes this
    quite difficult;

  - popt allows users to alias command line arguments;

  - popt provides convience functions for parsing strings into argv[] style
    arrays.")

other such libraries in that command-line flag definitions can be scattered
around the source code, and not just listed in one place such as @code{main}.
This means that a single source-code file will define and use flags that are
meaningful to that file.  Any application that links in that file will get the
flags, and the gflags library will automatically handle that flag
appropriately.")

command-line options using the getopt_long function found in GNU
libc, removing some of the tedium of this task for large programs
that accept many options.  The options parsed by the generated
function may be in both short (e.g., \"-h\") and long (\"--help\")
formats, as specified by the GNU coding standards.  Additionally, the
output of the standard options \"--help\" and \"--version\" is generated
automatically.")
