Subject: Fix two IAKERB comments

The comment explaining why there is no iakerb_gss_import_sec_context()
erroneously referenced SPNEGO instead of IAKERB (noticed by Ben
Kaduk).  The comment above iakerb_gss_delete_sec_context() is out of
date after the last commit.

(cherry picked from commit 92d6dd045dfc06cc03d20b327a6ee7a71e6bc24d)
