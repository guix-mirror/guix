;;; Comment:
;;;
;;; This module is similar to (gnu system services) module, but
;;; provides Home Services, which are supposed to be used for building
;;; home-environment.
;;;
;;; Home Services use the same extension as System Services.  Consult
;;; (gnu system services) module or manual for more information.
;;;
;;; home-service-type is a root of home services DAG.
;;;
;;; home-profile-service-type is almost the same as profile-service-type, at least
;;; for now.
;;;
;;; home-environment-variables-service-type generates a @file{setup-environment}
;;; shell script, which is expected to be sourced by login shell or other program,
;;; which starts early and spawns all other processes.  Home services for shells
;;; automatically add code for sourcing this file, if person do not use those home
;;; services they have to source this script manually in their's shell *profile
;;; file (details described in the manual).
;;;
;;; home-files-service-type is similar to etc-service-type, but doesn't extend
;;; home-activation, because deploy mechanism for config files is pluggable and
;;; can be different for different home environments: The default one is called
;;; symlink-manager (will be introudced in a separate patch series), which creates
;;; links for various dotfiles (like $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/$APP/...) to store, but is
;;; possible to implement alternative approaches like read-only home from Julien's
;;; guix-home-manager.
;;;
;;; home-run-on-first-login-service-type provides an @file{on-first-login} guile
;;; script, which runs provided gexps once, when user makes first login.  It can
;;; be used to start user's Shepherd and maybe some other process.  It relies on
;;; assumption that /run/user/$UID will be created on login by some login
;;; manager (elogind for example).
;;;
;;; home-activation-service-type provides an @file{activate} guile script, which
;;; do three main things:
;;;
;;; - Sets environment variables to the values declared in
;;; @file{setup-environment} shell script.  It's necessary, because user can set
;;; for example XDG_CONFIG_HOME and it should be respected by activation gexp of
;;; symlink-manager.
;;;
;;; - Sets GUIX_NEW_HOME and possibly GUIX_OLD_HOME vars to paths in the store.
;;; Later those variables can be used by activation gexps, for example by
;;; symlink-manager or run-on-change services.
;;;
;;; - Run all activation gexps provided by other home services.
;;;
;;; home-run-on-change-service-type allows to trigger actions during
;;; activation if file or directory specified by pattern is changed.
;;;
;;; Code:
