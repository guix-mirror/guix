#+TITLE: Tentative GNU Guix Road Map

Copyright © 2012 Ludovic Courtès <ludo@gnu.org>

The goals of the GNU Guix project are two-fold:

  - to build a purely functional package manager, based on Nix and
    Guile;

  - to use it to build a practical 100% free software distribution of
    GNU/Linux and possibly other GNU variants, with a focus on the
    promotion and tight integration of GNU components.

This documents lists tentative milestones toward these goals.


* GNU Guix 0.1: Dec. 2012

** basic package management facilities

Including install, upgrade, remove, roll-back, and search.

** self-contained user-land distribution

  - GNU/Linux-only, i686 and x86_64; optionally mipsel64
  - ~100 non-X11 packages

** maybe integrated Nix code

* GNU Guix 0.2: Feb./Mar. 2013

** improved package management features

  - user-environment hooks
  - sophisticated handling of collisions when building a union (package
    priorities, etc.)

** auto-update facility available for GNU packages

** more packages

  - Xorg
  - Emacs

* GNU Guix 0.9: June 2013

** bootable GNU/Linux-Libre distro
** high-level OS configuration descriptive EDSL, à la NixOS

* GNU Guix 1.0: September 2013 (GNU anniversary release)

** bootable GNU/Linux-Libre distro with non-GUI installer
** usable for a range of hacker-style uses
