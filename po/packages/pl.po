"Zip is a compression and file packaging/archive utility.  Zip is useful\n"
"for packaging a set of files for distribution, for archiving files, and for\n"
"saving disk space by temporarily compressing unused files or directories.\n"
"Zip puts one or more compressed files into a single ZIP archive, along with\n"
"information about the files (name, path, date, time of last modification,\n"
"protection, and check information to verify file integrity).  An entire\n"
"directory structure can be packed into a ZIP archive with a single command.\n"

"Zip has one compression method (deflation) and can also store files without\n"
"compression.  Zip automatically chooses the better of the two for each file.\n"
"Compression ratios of 2:1 to 3:1 are common for text files."
