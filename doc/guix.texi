@chapter Introduction

@cindex purpose
GNU Guix@footnote{``Guix'' is pronounced like ``geeks'', or ``ɡiːks''
using the international phonetic alphabet (IPA).} is a package
management tool for and distribution of the GNU system.
Guix makes it easy for unprivileged
users to install, upgrade, or remove software packages, to roll back to a
previous package set, to build packages from source, and generally
assists with the creation and maintenance of software environments.

@cindex Guix System
@cindex GuixSD, now Guix System
@cindex Guix System Distribution, now Guix System
You can install GNU@tie{}Guix on top of an existing GNU/Linux system where it
complements the available tools without interference (@pxref{Installation}),
or you can use it as a standalone operating system distribution,
@dfn{Guix@tie{}System}@footnote{We used to refer to Guix System as ``Guix
System Distribution'' or ``GuixSD''.  We now consider it makes more sense to
group everything under the ``Guix'' banner since, after all, Guix System is
readily available through the @command{guix system} command, even if you're
using a different distro underneath!}.  @xref{GNU Distribution}.

@node Managing Software the Guix Way
@section Managing Software the Guix Way

@cindex user interfaces
Guix provides a command-line package management interface
(@pxref{Package Management}), tools to help with software development
(@pxref{Development}), command-line utilities for more advanced usage,
(@pxref{Utilities}), as well as Scheme programming interfaces
(@pxref{Programming Interface}).
@cindex build daemon
Its @dfn{build daemon} is responsible for building packages on behalf of
users (@pxref{Setting Up the Daemon}) and for downloading pre-built
binaries from authorized sources (@pxref{Substitutes}).

@cindex extensibility of the distribution
@cindex customization, of packages
Guix includes package definitions for many GNU and non-GNU packages, all
of which @uref{https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html, respect the
user's computing freedom}.  It is @emph{extensible}: users can write
their own package definitions (@pxref{Defining Packages}) and make them
available as independent package modules (@pxref{Package Modules}).  It
is also @emph{customizable}: users can @emph{derive} specialized package
definitions from existing ones, including from the command line
(@pxref{Package Transformation Options}).

@cindex functional package management
@cindex isolation
Under the hood, Guix implements the @dfn{functional package management}
discipline pioneered by Nix (@pxref{Acknowledgments}).
In Guix, the package build and installation process is seen
as a @emph{function}, in the mathematical sense.  That function takes inputs,
such as build scripts, a compiler, and libraries, and
returns an installed package.  As a pure function, its result depends
solely on its inputs---for instance, it cannot refer to software or
scripts that were not explicitly passed as inputs.  A build function
always produces the same result when passed a given set of inputs.  It
cannot alter the environment of the running system in
any way; for instance, it cannot create, modify, or delete files outside
of its build and installation directories.  This is achieved by running
build processes in isolated environments (or @dfn{containers}), where only their
explicit inputs are visible.

@cindex store
The result of package build functions is @dfn{cached} in the file
system, in a special directory called @dfn{the store} (@pxref{The
Store}).  Each package is installed in a directory of its own in the
store---by default under @file{/gnu/store}.  The directory name contains
a hash of all the inputs used to build that package; thus, changing an
input yields a different directory name.

This approach is the foundation for the salient features of Guix: support
for transactional package upgrade and rollback, per-user installation, and
garbage collection of packages (@pxref{Features}).


@node GNU Distribution
@section GNU Distribution

@cindex Guix System
Guix comes with a distribution of the GNU system consisting entirely of
free software@footnote{The term ``free'' here refers to the
@url{http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html,freedom provided to
users of that software}.}.  The
distribution can be installed on its own (@pxref{System Installation}),
but it is also possible to install Guix as a package manager on top of
an installed GNU/Linux system (@pxref{Installation}).  When we need to
distinguish between the two, we refer to the standalone distribution as
Guix@tie{}System.

The distribution provides core GNU packages such as GNU libc, GCC, and
Binutils, as well as many GNU and non-GNU applications.  The complete
list of available packages can be browsed
@url{http://www.gnu.org/software/guix/packages,on-line} or by
running @command{guix package} (@pxref{Invoking guix package}):

@example
guix package --list-available
@end example

Our goal is to provide a practical 100% free software distribution of
Linux-based and other variants of GNU, with a focus on the promotion and
tight integration of GNU components, and an emphasis on programs and
tools that help users exert that freedom.

Packages are currently available on the following platforms:

@table @code

@item x86_64-linux
Intel/AMD @code{x86_64} architecture, Linux-Libre kernel;

@item i686-linux
Intel 32-bit architecture (IA32), Linux-Libre kernel;

@item armhf-linux
ARMv7-A architecture with hard float, Thumb-2 and NEON,
using the EABI hard-float application binary interface (ABI),
and Linux-Libre kernel.

@item aarch64-linux
little-endian 64-bit ARMv8-A processors, Linux-Libre kernel.  This is
currently in an experimental stage, with limited support.
@xref{Contributing}, for how to help!

@item mips64el-linux
little-endian 64-bit MIPS processors, specifically the Loongson series,
n32 ABI, and Linux-Libre kernel.

@end table

With Guix@tie{}System, you @emph{declare} all aspects of the operating system
configuration and Guix takes care of instantiating the configuration in a
transactional, reproducible, and stateless fashion (@pxref{System
Configuration}).  Guix System uses the Linux-libre kernel, the Shepherd
initialization system (@pxref{Introduction,,, shepherd, The GNU Shepherd
Manual}), the well-known GNU utilities and tool chain, as well as the
graphical environment or system services of your choice.

Guix System is available on all the above platforms except
@code{mips64el-linux}.

@noindent
For information on porting to other architectures or kernels,
@pxref{Porting}.

Building this distribution is a cooperative effort, and you are invited
to join!  @xref{Contributing}, for information about how you can help.

@node Installation
@chapter Installation

@cindex installing Guix

@quotation Note
We recommend the use of this
@uref{https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guix.git/plain/etc/guix-install.sh,
shell installer script} to install Guix on top of a running GNU/Linux system,
thereafter called a @dfn{foreign distro}.@footnote{This section is concerned
with the installation of the package manager, which can be done on top of a
running GNU/Linux system.  If, instead, you want to install the complete GNU
operating system, @pxref{System Installation}.} The script automates the
download, installation, and initial configuration of Guix.  It should be run
as the root user.
@end quotation

@cindex foreign distro
@cindex directories related to foreign distro
When installed on a foreign distro, GNU@tie{}Guix complements the available
tools without interference.  Its data lives exclusively in two directories,
usually @file{/gnu/store} and @file{/var/guix}; other files on your system,
such as @file{/etc}, are left untouched.

Once installed, Guix can be updated by running @command{guix pull}
(@pxref{Invoking guix pull}).

If you prefer to perform the installation steps manually or want to tweak
them, you may find the following subsections useful.  They describe the
software requirements of Guix, as well as how to install it manually and get
ready to use it.

@end menu

@node Binary Installation
@section Binary Installation

@cindex installing Guix from binaries
@cindex installer script
This section describes how to install Guix on an arbitrary system from a
self-contained tarball providing binaries for Guix and for all its
dependencies.  This is often quicker than installing from source, which
is described in the next sections.  The only requirement is to have
GNU@tie{}tar and Xz.

Installing goes along these lines:

@enumerate
@item
@cindex downloading Guix binary
Download the binary tarball from
@indicateurl{https://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/guix/guix-binary-@value{VERSION}.@var{system}.tar.xz},
where @var{system} is @code{x86_64-linux} for an @code{x86_64} machine
already running the kernel Linux, and so on.

@c The following is somewhat duplicated in ``System Installation''.
Make sure to download the associated @file{.sig} file and to verify the
authenticity of the tarball against it, along these lines:

@example
$ wget https://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/guix/guix-binary-@value{VERSION}.@var{system}.tar.xz.sig
$ gpg --verify guix-binary-@value{VERSION}.@var{system}.tar.xz.sig
@end example

If that command fails because you do not have the required public key,
then run this command to import it:

@example
$ gpg --keyserver @value{KEY-SERVER} \
      --recv-keys @value{OPENPGP-SIGNING-KEY-ID}
@end example

@noindent
and rerun the @code{gpg --verify} command.
@c end authentication part

@item
Now, you need to become the @code{root} user.  Depending on your distribution,
you may have to run @code{su -} or @code{sudo -i}.  As @code{root}, run:

@example
# cd /tmp
# tar --warning=no-timestamp -xf \
     guix-binary-@value{VERSION}.@var{system}.tar.xz
# mv var/guix /var/ && mv gnu /
@end example

This creates @file{/gnu/store} (@pxref{The Store}) and @file{/var/guix}.
The latter contains a ready-to-use profile for @code{root} (see next
step.)

Do @emph{not} unpack the tarball on a working Guix system since that
would overwrite its own essential files.

The @code{--warning=no-timestamp} option makes sure GNU@tie{}tar does
not emit warnings about ``implausibly old time stamps'' (such
warnings were triggered by GNU@tie{}tar 1.26 and older; recent
versions are fine.)
They stem from the fact that all the
files in the archive have their modification time set to zero (which
means January 1st, 1970.)  This is done on purpose to make sure the
archive content is independent of its creation time, thus making it
reproducible.

@item
Make the profile available under @file{~root/.config/guix/current}, which is
where @command{guix pull} will install updates (@pxref{Invoking guix pull}):

@example
# mkdir -p ~root/.config/guix
# ln -sf /var/guix/profiles/per-user/root/current-guix \
         ~root/.config/guix/current
@end example

Source @file{etc/profile} to augment @code{PATH} and other relevant
environment variables:

@example
# GUIX_PROFILE="`echo ~root`/.config/guix/current" ; \
  source $GUIX_PROFILE/etc/profile
@end example

@item
Create the group and user accounts for build users as explained below
(@pxref{Build Environment Setup}).

@item
Run the daemon, and set it to automatically start on boot.

If your host distro uses the systemd init system, this can be achieved
with these commands:

@c Versions of systemd that supported symlinked service files are not
@c yet widely deployed, so we should suggest that users copy the service
@c files into place.
@c
@c See this thread for more information:
@c http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/guix-devel/2017-01/msg01199.html

@example
# cp ~root/.config/guix/current/lib/systemd/system/guix-daemon.service \
     /etc/systemd/system/
# systemctl start guix-daemon && systemctl enable guix-daemon
@end example

If your host distro uses the Upstart init system:

@example
# initctl reload-configuration
# cp ~root/.config/guix/current/lib/upstart/system/guix-daemon.conf \
     /etc/init/
# start guix-daemon
@end example

Otherwise, you can still start the daemon manually with:

@example
# ~root/.config/guix/current/bin/guix-daemon \
       --build-users-group=guixbuild
@end example

@item
Make the @command{guix} command available to other users on the machine,
for instance with:

@example
# mkdir -p /usr/local/bin
# cd /usr/local/bin
# ln -s /var/guix/profiles/per-user/root/current-guix/bin/guix
@end example

It is also a good idea to make the Info version of this manual available
there:

@example
# mkdir -p /usr/local/share/info
# cd /usr/local/share/info
# for i in /var/guix/profiles/per-user/root/current-guix/share/info/* ;
  do ln -s $i ; done
@end example

That way, assuming @file{/usr/local/share/info} is in the search path,
running @command{info guix} will open this manual (@pxref{Other Info
Directories,,, texinfo, GNU Texinfo}, for more details on changing the
Info search path.)

@item
@cindex substitutes, authorization thereof
To use substitutes from @code{@value{SUBSTITUTE-SERVER}} or one of its mirrors
(@pxref{Substitutes}), authorize them:

@example
# guix archive --authorize < \
     ~root/.config/guix/current/share/guix/@value{SUBSTITUTE-SERVER}.pub
@end example

@item
Each user may need to perform a few additional steps to make their Guix
environment ready for use, @pxref{Application Setup}.
@end enumerate

Voilà, the installation is complete!

You can confirm that Guix is working by installing a sample package into
the root profile:

@example
# guix package -i hello
@end example

The @code{guix} package must remain available in @code{root}'s profile,
or it would become subject to garbage collection---in which case you
would find yourself badly handicapped by the lack of the @command{guix}
command.  In other words, do not remove @code{guix} by running
@code{guix package -r guix}.

The binary installation tarball can be (re)produced and verified simply
by running the following command in the Guix source tree:

@example
make guix-binary.@var{system}.tar.xz
@end example

@noindent
...@: which, in turn, runs:

@example
guix pack -s @var{system} --localstatedir \
  --profile-name=current-guix guix
@end example

@node Requirements
@section Requirements

This section lists requirements when building Guix from source.  The
build procedure for Guix is the same as for other GNU software, and is
not covered here.  Please see the files @file{README} and @file{INSTALL}
in the Guix source tree for additional details.

@cindex official website
GNU Guix is available for download from its website at
@url{https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/}.

GNU Guix depends on the following packages:

@itemize
@item @url{http://gnu.org/software/guile/, GNU Guile}, version 2.2.x;
@item @url{https://notabug.org/cwebber/guile-gcrypt, Guile-Gcrypt}, version
0.1.0 or later;
@item
@uref{http://gnutls.org/, GnuTLS}, specifically its Guile bindings
(@pxref{Guile Preparations, how to install the GnuTLS bindings for
Guile,, gnutls-guile, GnuTLS-Guile});
@item
@uref{https://notabug.org/guile-sqlite3/guile-sqlite3, Guile-SQLite3}, version 0.1.0
or later;
@item
@c FIXME: Specify a version number once a release has been made.
@uref{https://gitlab.com/guile-git/guile-git, Guile-Git}, from August
2017 or later;
@item @uref{https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/guile-json/, Guile-JSON};
@item @url{http://zlib.net, zlib};
@item @url{http://www.gnu.org/software/make/, GNU Make}.
@end itemize

The following dependencies are optional:

@itemize
@item
@c Note: We need at least 0.10.2 for 'channel-send-eof'.
Support for build offloading (@pxref{Daemon Offload Setup}) and
@command{guix copy} (@pxref{Invoking guix copy}) depends on
@uref{https://github.com/artyom-poptsov/guile-ssh, Guile-SSH},
version 0.10.2 or later.

@item
When @url{http://www.bzip.org, libbz2} is available,
@command{guix-daemon} can use it to compress build logs.
@end itemize

Unless @code{--disable-daemon} was passed to @command{configure}, the
following packages are also needed:

@itemize
@item @url{http://gnupg.org/, GNU libgcrypt};
@item @url{http://sqlite.org, SQLite 3};
@item @url{http://gcc.gnu.org, GCC's g++}, with support for the
C++11 standard.
@end itemize

@cindex state directory
When configuring Guix on a system that already has a Guix installation,
be sure to specify the same state directory as the existing installation
using the @code{--localstatedir} option of the @command{configure}
script (@pxref{Directory Variables, @code{localstatedir},, standards,
GNU Coding Standards}).  The @command{configure} script protects against
unintended misconfiguration of @var{localstatedir} so you do not
inadvertently corrupt your store (@pxref{The Store}).

@cindex Nix, compatibility
When a working installation of @url{http://nixos.org/nix/, the Nix package
manager} is available, you
can instead configure Guix with @code{--disable-daemon}.  In that case,
Nix replaces the three dependencies above.

Guix is compatible with Nix, so it is possible to share the same store
between both.  To do so, you must pass @command{configure} not only the
same @code{--with-store-dir} value, but also the same
@code{--localstatedir} value.  The latter is essential because it
specifies where the database that stores metadata about the store is
located, among other things.  The default values for Nix are
@code{--with-store-dir=/nix/store} and @code{--localstatedir=/nix/var}.
Note that @code{--disable-daemon} is not required if
your goal is to share the store with Nix.

@node Running the Test Suite
@section Running the Test Suite

@cindex test suite
After a successful @command{configure} and @code{make} run, it is a good
idea to run the test suite.  It can help catch issues with the setup or
environment, or bugs in Guix itself---and really, reporting test
failures is a good way to help improve the software.  To run the test
suite, type:

@example
make check
@end example

Test cases can run in parallel: you can use the @code{-j} option of
GNU@tie{}make to speed things up.  The first run may take a few minutes
on a recent machine; subsequent runs will be faster because the store
that is created for test purposes will already have various things in
cache.

It is also possible to run a subset of the tests by defining the
@code{TESTS} makefile variable as in this example:

@example
make check TESTS="tests/store.scm tests/cpio.scm"
@end example

By default, tests results are displayed at a file level.  In order to
see the details of every individual test cases, it is possible to define
the @code{SCM_LOG_DRIVER_FLAGS} makefile variable as in this example:

@example
make check TESTS="tests/base64.scm" SCM_LOG_DRIVER_FLAGS="--brief=no"
@end example

Upon failure, please email @email{bug-guix@@gnu.org} and attach the
@file{test-suite.log} file.  Please specify the Guix version being used
as well as version numbers of the dependencies (@pxref{Requirements}) in
your message.

Guix also comes with a whole-system test suite that tests complete
Guix System instances.  It can only run on systems where
Guix is already installed, using:

@example
make check-system
@end example

@noindent
or, again, by defining @code{TESTS} to select a subset of tests to run:

@example
make check-system TESTS="basic mcron"
@end example

These system tests are defined in the @code{(gnu tests @dots{})}
modules.  They work by running the operating systems under test with
lightweight instrumentation in a virtual machine (VM).  They can be
computationally intensive or rather cheap, depending on whether
substitutes are available for their dependencies (@pxref{Substitutes}).
Some of them require a lot of storage space to hold VM images.

Again in case of test failures, please send @email{bug-guix@@gnu.org}
all the details.

@node Setting Up the Daemon
@section Setting Up the Daemon

@cindex daemon
Operations such as building a package or running the garbage collector
are all performed by a specialized process, the @dfn{build daemon}, on
behalf of clients.  Only the daemon may access the store and its
associated database.  Thus, any operation that manipulates the store
goes through the daemon.  For instance, command-line tools such as
@command{guix package} and @command{guix build} communicate with the
daemon (@i{via} remote procedure calls) to instruct it what to do.

The following sections explain how to prepare the build daemon's
environment.  See also @ref{Substitutes}, for information on how to allow
the daemon to download pre-built binaries.

@menu
* Build Environment Setup::     Preparing the isolated build environment.
* Daemon Offload Setup::        Offloading builds to remote machines.
* SELinux Support::             Using an SELinux policy for the daemon.
@end menu

@node Build Environment Setup
@subsection Build Environment Setup

@cindex build environment
In a standard multi-user setup, Guix and its daemon---the
@command{guix-daemon} program---are installed by the system
administrator; @file{/gnu/store} is owned by @code{root} and
@command{guix-daemon} runs as @code{root}.  Unprivileged users may use
Guix tools to build packages or otherwise access the store, and the
daemon will do it on their behalf, ensuring that the store is kept in a
consistent state, and allowing built packages to be shared among users.

@cindex build users
When @command{guix-daemon} runs as @code{root}, you may not want package
build processes themselves to run as @code{root} too, for obvious
security reasons.  To avoid that, a special pool of @dfn{build users}
should be created for use by build processes started by the daemon.
These build users need not have a shell and a home directory: they will
just be used when the daemon drops @code{root} privileges in build
processes.  Having several such users allows the daemon to launch
distinct build processes under separate UIDs, which guarantees that they
do not interfere with each other---an essential feature since builds are
regarded as pure functions (@pxref{Introduction}).

On a GNU/Linux system, a build user pool may be created like this (using
Bash syntax and the @code{shadow} commands):

@c See http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-guix/2013-01/msg00239.html
@c for why `-G' is needed.
@example
# groupadd --system guixbuild
# for i in `seq -w 1 10`;
  do
    useradd -g guixbuild -G guixbuild           \
            -d /var/empty -s `which nologin`    \
            -c "Guix build user $i" --system    \
            guixbuilder$i;
  done
@end example

@noindent
The number of build users determines how many build jobs may run in
parallel, as specified by the @option{--max-jobs} option
(@pxref{Invoking guix-daemon, @option{--max-jobs}}).  To use
@command{guix system vm} and related commands, you may need to add the
build users to the @code{kvm} group so they can access @file{/dev/kvm},
using @code{-G guixbuild,kvm} instead of @code{-G guixbuild}
(@pxref{Invoking guix system}).

The @code{guix-daemon} program may then be run as @code{root} with the
following command@footnote{If your machine uses the systemd init system,
dropping the @file{@var{prefix}/lib/systemd/system/guix-daemon.service}
file in @file{/etc/systemd/system} will ensure that
@command{guix-daemon} is automatically started.  Similarly, if your
machine uses the Upstart init system, drop the
@file{@var{prefix}/lib/upstart/system/guix-daemon.conf}
file in @file{/etc/init}.}:

@example
# guix-daemon --build-users-group=guixbuild
@end example

@cindex chroot
@noindent
This way, the daemon starts build processes in a chroot, under one of
the @code{guixbuilder} users.  On GNU/Linux, by default, the chroot
environment contains nothing but:

@c Keep this list in sync with libstore/build.cc! -----------------------
@itemize
@item
a minimal @code{/dev} directory, created mostly independently from the
host @code{/dev}@footnote{``Mostly'', because while the set of files
that appear in the chroot's @code{/dev} is fixed, most of these files
can only be created if the host has them.};

@item
the @code{/proc} directory; it only shows the processes of the container
since a separate PID name space is used;

@item
@file{/etc/passwd} with an entry for the current user and an entry for
user @file{nobody};

@item
@file{/etc/group} with an entry for the user's group;

@item
@file{/etc/hosts} with an entry that maps @code{localhost} to
@code{127.0.0.1};

@item
a writable @file{/tmp} directory.
@end itemize

You can influence the directory where the daemon stores build trees
@i{via} the @code{TMPDIR} environment variable.  However, the build tree
within the chroot is always called @file{/tmp/guix-build-@var{name}.drv-0},
where @var{name} is the derivation name---e.g., @code{coreutils-8.24}.
This way, the value of @code{TMPDIR} does not leak inside build
environments, which avoids discrepancies in cases where build processes
capture the name of their build tree.

@vindex http_proxy
The daemon also honors the @code{http_proxy} environment variable for
HTTP downloads it performs, be it for fixed-output derivations
(@pxref{Derivations}) or for substitutes (@pxref{Substitutes}).

If you are installing Guix as an unprivileged user, it is still possible
to run @command{guix-daemon} provided you pass @code{--disable-chroot}.
However, build processes will not be isolated from one another, and not
from the rest of the system.  Thus, build processes may interfere with
each other, and may access programs, libraries, and other files
available on the system---making it much harder to view them as
@emph{pure} functions.


@node Daemon Offload Setup
@subsection Using the Offload Facility

@cindex offloading
@cindex build hook
When desired, the build daemon can @dfn{offload} derivation builds to
other machines running Guix, using the @code{offload} @dfn{build
hook}@footnote{This feature is available only when
@uref{https://github.com/artyom-poptsov/guile-ssh, Guile-SSH} is
present.}.  When that
feature is enabled, a list of user-specified build machines is read from
@file{/etc/guix/machines.scm}; every time a build is requested, for
instance via @code{guix build}, the daemon attempts to offload it to one
of the machines that satisfy the constraints of the derivation, in
particular its system type---e.g., @file{x86_64-linux}.  Missing
prerequisites for the build are copied over SSH to the target machine,
which then proceeds with the build; upon success the output(s) of the
build are copied back to the initial machine.

The @file{/etc/guix/machines.scm} file typically looks like this:

@example
(list (build-machine
        (name "eightysix.example.org")
        (system "x86_64-linux")
        (host-key "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3Nza@dots{}")
        (user "bob")
        (speed 2.))     ;incredibly fast!

      (build-machine
        (name "meeps.example.org")
        (system "mips64el-linux")
        (host-key "ssh-rsa AAAAB3Nza@dots{}")
        (user "alice")
        (private-key
         (string-append (getenv "HOME")
                        "/.ssh/identity-for-guix"))))
@end example

@noindent
In the example above we specify a list of two build machines, one for
the @code{x86_64} architecture and one for the @code{mips64el}
architecture.

In fact, this file is---not surprisingly!---a Scheme file that is
evaluated when the @code{offload} hook is started.  Its return value
must be a list of @code{build-machine} objects.  While this example
shows a fixed list of build machines, one could imagine, say, using
DNS-SD to return a list of potential build machines discovered in the
local network (@pxref{Introduction, Guile-Avahi,, guile-avahi, Using
Avahi in Guile Scheme Programs}).  The @code{build-machine} data type is
detailed below.

@deftp {Data Type} build-machine
This data type represents build machines to which the daemon may offload
builds.  The important fields are:

@table @code

@item name
The host name of the remote machine.

@item system
The system type of the remote machine---e.g., @code{"x86_64-linux"}.

@item user
The user account to use when connecting to the remote machine over SSH.
Note that the SSH key pair must @emph{not} be passphrase-protected, to
allow non-interactive logins.

@item host-key
This must be the machine's SSH @dfn{public host key} in OpenSSH format.
This is used to authenticate the machine when we connect to it.  It is a
long string that looks like this:

@example
ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC@dots{}mde+UhL hint@@example.org
@end example

If the machine is running the OpenSSH daemon, @command{sshd}, the host
key can be found in a file such as
@file{/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub}.

If the machine is running the SSH daemon of GNU@tie{}lsh,
@command{lshd}, the host key is in @file{/etc/lsh/host-key.pub} or a
similar file.  It can be converted to the OpenSSH format using
@command{lsh-export-key} (@pxref{Converting keys,,, lsh, LSH Manual}):

@example
$ lsh-export-key --openssh < /etc/lsh/host-key.pub 
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAAEOp8FoQAAAQEAs1eB46LV@dots{}
@end example

@end table

A number of optional fields may be specified:

@table @asis

@item @code{port} (default: @code{22})
Port number of SSH server on the machine.

@item @code{private-key} (default: @file{~root/.ssh/id_rsa})
The SSH private key file to use when connecting to the machine, in
OpenSSH format.  This key must not be protected with a passphrase.

Note that the default value is the private key @emph{of the root
account}.  Make sure it exists if you use the default.

@item @code{compression} (default: @code{"zlib@@openssh.com,zlib"})
@itemx @code{compression-level} (default: @code{3})
The SSH-level compression methods and compression level requested.

Note that offloading relies on SSH compression to reduce bandwidth usage
when transferring files to and from build machines.

@item @code{daemon-socket} (default: @code{"/var/guix/daemon-socket/socket"})
File name of the Unix-domain socket @command{guix-daemon} is listening
to on that machine.

@item @code{parallel-builds} (default: @code{1})
The number of builds that may run in parallel on the machine.

@item @code{speed} (default: @code{1.0})
A ``relative speed factor''.  The offload scheduler will tend to prefer
machines with a higher speed factor.

@item @code{features} (default: @code{'()})
A list of strings denoting specific features supported by the machine.
An example is @code{"kvm"} for machines that have the KVM Linux modules
and corresponding hardware support.  Derivations can request features by
name, and they will be scheduled on matching build machines.

@end table
@end deftp

The @command{guix} command must be in the search path on the build
machines.  You can check whether this is the case by running:

@example
ssh build-machine guix repl --version
@end example

There is one last thing to do once @file{machines.scm} is in place.  As
explained above, when offloading, files are transferred back and forth
between the machine stores.  For this to work, you first need to
generate a key pair on each machine to allow the daemon to export signed
archives of files from the store (@pxref{Invoking guix archive}):

@example
# guix archive --generate-key
@end example

@noindent
Each build machine must authorize the key of the master machine so that
it accepts store items it receives from the master:

@example
# guix archive --authorize < master-public-key.txt
@end example

@noindent
Likewise, the master machine must authorize the key of each build machine.

All the fuss with keys is here to express pairwise mutual trust
relations between the master and the build machines.  Concretely, when
the master receives files from a build machine (and @i{vice versa}), its
build daemon can make sure they are genuine, have not been tampered
with, and that they are signed by an authorized key.

@cindex offload test
To test whether your setup is operational, run this command on the
master node:

@example
# guix offload test
@end example

This will attempt to connect to each of the build machines specified in
@file{/etc/guix/machines.scm}, make sure Guile and the Guix modules are
available on each machine, attempt to export to the machine and import
from it, and report any error in the process.

If you want to test a different machine file, just specify it on the
command line:

@example
# guix offload test machines-qualif.scm
@end example

Last, you can test the subset of the machines whose name matches a
regular expression like this:

@example
# guix offload test machines.scm '\.gnu\.org$'
@end example

@cindex offload status
To display the current load of all build hosts, run this command on the
main node:

@example
# guix offload status
@end example


@node SELinux Support
@subsection SELinux Support

@cindex SELinux, daemon policy
@cindex mandatory access control, SELinux
@cindex security, guix-daemon
Guix includes an SELinux policy file at @file{etc/guix-daemon.cil} that
can be installed on a system where SELinux is enabled, in order to label
Guix files and to specify the expected behavior of the daemon.  Since
Guix System does not provide an SELinux base policy, the daemon policy cannot
be used on Guix System.

@subsubsection Installing the SELinux policy
@cindex SELinux, policy installation
To install the policy run this command as root:

@example
semodule -i etc/guix-daemon.cil
@end example

Then relabel the file system with @code{restorecon} or by a different
mechanism provided by your system.

Once the policy is installed, the file system has been relabeled, and
the daemon has been restarted, it should be running in the
@code{guix_daemon_t} context.  You can confirm this with the following
command:

@example
ps -Zax | grep guix-daemon
@end example

Monitor the SELinux log files as you run a command like @code{guix build
hello} to convince yourself that SELinux permits all necessary
operations.

@subsubsection Limitations
@cindex SELinux, limitations

This policy is not perfect.  Here is a list of limitations or quirks
that should be considered when deploying the provided SELinux policy for
the Guix daemon.

@enumerate
@item
@code{guix_daemon_socket_t} isn’t actually used.  None of the socket
operations involve contexts that have anything to do with
@code{guix_daemon_socket_t}.  It doesn’t hurt to have this unused label,
but it would be preferrable to define socket rules for only this label.

@item
@code{guix gc} cannot access arbitrary links to profiles.  By design,
the file label of the destination of a symlink is independent of the
file label of the link itself.  Although all profiles under
$localstatedir are labelled, the links to these profiles inherit the
label of the directory they are in.  For links in the user’s home
directory this will be @code{user_home_t}.  But for links from the root
user’s home directory, or @file{/tmp}, or the HTTP server’s working
directory, etc, this won’t work.  @code{guix gc} would be prevented from
reading and following these links.

@item
The daemon’s feature to listen for TCP connections might no longer work.
This might require extra rules, because SELinux treats network sockets
differently from files.

@item
Currently all files with a name matching the regular expression
@code{/gnu/store/.+-(guix-.+|profile)/bin/guix-daemon} are assigned the
label @code{guix_daemon_exec_t}; this means that @emph{any} file with
that name in any profile would be permitted to run in the
@code{guix_daemon_t} domain.  This is not ideal.  An attacker could
build a package that provides this executable and convince a user to
install and run it, which lifts it into the @code{guix_daemon_t} domain.
At that point SELinux could not prevent it from accessing files that are
allowed for processes in that domain.

We could generate a much more restrictive policy at installation time,
so that only the @emph{exact} file name of the currently installed
@code{guix-daemon} executable would be labelled with
@code{guix_daemon_exec_t}, instead of using a broad regular expression.
The downside is that root would have to install or upgrade the policy at
installation time whenever the Guix package that provides the
effectively running @code{guix-daemon} executable is upgraded.
@end enumerate

@node Invoking guix-daemon
@section Invoking @command{guix-daemon}

The @command{guix-daemon} program implements all the functionality to
access the store.  This includes launching build processes, running the
garbage collector, querying the availability of a build result, etc.  It
is normally run as @code{root} like this:

@example
# guix-daemon --build-users-group=guixbuild
@end example

@noindent
For details on how to set it up, @pxref{Setting Up the Daemon}.

@cindex chroot
@cindex container, build environment
@cindex build environment
@cindex reproducible builds
By default, @command{guix-daemon} launches build processes under
different UIDs, taken from the build group specified with
@code{--build-users-group}.  In addition, each build process is run in a
chroot environment that only contains the subset of the store that the
build process depends on, as specified by its derivation
(@pxref{Programming Interface, derivation}), plus a set of specific
system directories.  By default, the latter contains @file{/dev} and
@file{/dev/pts}.  Furthermore, on GNU/Linux, the build environment is a
@dfn{container}: in addition to having its own file system tree, it has
a separate mount name space, its own PID name space, network name space,
etc.  This helps achieve reproducible builds (@pxref{Features}).

When the daemon performs a build on behalf of the user, it creates a
build directory under @file{/tmp} or under the directory specified by
its @code{TMPDIR} environment variable.  This directory is shared with
the container for the duration of the build, though within the container,
the build tree is always called @file{/tmp/guix-build-@var{name}.drv-0}.

The build directory is automatically deleted upon completion, unless the
build failed and the client specified @option{--keep-failed}
(@pxref{Invoking guix build, @option{--keep-failed}}).

The daemon listens for connections and spawns one sub-process for each session
started by a client (one of the @command{guix} sub-commands.)  The
@command{guix processes} command allows you to get an overview of the activity
on your system by viewing each of the active sessions and clients.
@xref{Invoking guix processes}, for more information.

The following command-line options are supported:

@table @code
@item --build-users-group=@var{group}
Take users from @var{group} to run build processes (@pxref{Setting Up
the Daemon, build users}).

@item --no-substitutes
@cindex substitutes
Do not use substitutes for build products.  That is, always build things
locally instead of allowing downloads of pre-built binaries
(@pxref{Substitutes}).

When the daemon runs with @code{--no-substitutes}, clients can still
explicitly enable substitution @i{via} the @code{set-build-options}
remote procedure call (@pxref{The Store}).

@item --substitute-urls=@var{urls}
@anchor{daemon-substitute-urls}
Consider @var{urls} the default whitespace-separated list of substitute
source URLs.  When this option is omitted,
@indicateurl{https://@value{SUBSTITUTE-SERVER}} is used.

This means that substitutes may be downloaded from @var{urls}, as long
as they are signed by a trusted signature (@pxref{Substitutes}).

@cindex build hook
@item --no-build-hook
Do not use the @dfn{build hook}.

The build hook is a helper program that the daemon can start and to
which it submits build requests.  This mechanism is used to offload
builds to other machines (@pxref{Daemon Offload Setup}).

@item --cache-failures
Cache build failures.  By default, only successful builds are cached.

When this option is used, @command{guix gc --list-failures} can be used
to query the set of store items marked as failed; @command{guix gc
--clear-failures} removes store items from the set of cached failures.
@xref{Invoking guix gc}.

@item --cores=@var{n}
@itemx -c @var{n}
Use @var{n} CPU cores to build each derivation; @code{0} means as many
as available.

The default value is @code{0}, but it may be overridden by clients, such
as the @code{--cores} option of @command{guix build} (@pxref{Invoking
guix build}).

The effect is to define the @code{NIX_BUILD_CORES} environment variable
in the build process, which can then use it to exploit internal
parallelism---for instance, by running @code{make -j$NIX_BUILD_CORES}.

@item --max-jobs=@var{n}
@itemx -M @var{n}
Allow at most @var{n} build jobs in parallel.  The default value is
@code{1}.  Setting it to @code{0} means that no builds will be performed
locally; instead, the daemon will offload builds (@pxref{Daemon Offload
Setup}), or simply fail.

@item --max-silent-time=@var{seconds}
When the build or substitution process remains silent for more than
@var{seconds}, terminate it and report a build failure.

The default value is @code{0}, which disables the timeout.

The value specified here can be overridden by clients (@pxref{Common
Build Options, @code{--max-silent-time}}).

@item --timeout=@var{seconds}
Likewise, when the build or substitution process lasts for more than
@var{seconds}, terminate it and report a build failure.

The default value is @code{0}, which disables the timeout.

The value specified here can be overridden by clients (@pxref{Common
Build Options, @code{--timeout}}).

@item --rounds=@var{N}
Build each derivation @var{n} times in a row, and raise an error if
consecutive build results are not bit-for-bit identical.  Note that this
setting can be overridden by clients such as @command{guix build}
(@pxref{Invoking guix build}).

When used in conjunction with @option{--keep-failed}, the differing
output is kept in the store, under @file{/gnu/store/@dots{}-check}.
This makes it easy to look for differences between the two results.

@item --debug
Produce debugging output.

This is useful to debug daemon start-up issues, but then it may be
overridden by clients, for example the @code{--verbosity} option of
@command{guix build} (@pxref{Invoking guix build}).

@item --chroot-directory=@var{dir}
Add @var{dir} to the build chroot.

Doing this may change the result of build processes---for instance if
they use optional dependencies found in @var{dir} when it is available,
and not otherwise.  For that reason, it is not recommended to do so.
Instead, make sure that each derivation declares all the inputs that it
needs.

@item --disable-chroot
Disable chroot builds.

Using this option is not recommended since, again, it would allow build
processes to gain access to undeclared dependencies.  It is necessary,
though, when @command{guix-daemon} is running under an unprivileged user
account.

@item --log-compression=@var{type}
Compress build logs according to @var{type}, one of @code{gzip},
@code{bzip2}, or @code{none}.

Unless @code{--lose-logs} is used, all the build logs are kept in the
@var{localstatedir}.  To save space, the daemon automatically compresses
them with bzip2 by default.

@item --disable-deduplication
@cindex deduplication
Disable automatic file ``deduplication'' in the store.

By default, files added to the store are automatically ``deduplicated'':
if a newly added file is identical to another one found in the store,
the daemon makes the new file a hard link to the other file.  This can
noticeably reduce disk usage, at the expense of slightly increased
input/output load at the end of a build process.  This option disables
this optimization.

@item --gc-keep-outputs[=yes|no]
Tell whether the garbage collector (GC) must keep outputs of live
derivations.

@cindex GC roots
@cindex garbage collector roots
When set to ``yes'', the GC will keep the outputs of any live derivation
available in the store---the @code{.drv} files.  The default is ``no'',
meaning that derivation outputs are kept only if they are reachable from a GC
root.  @xref{Invoking guix gc}, for more on GC roots.

@item --gc-keep-derivations[=yes|no]
Tell whether the garbage collector (GC) must keep derivations
corresponding to live outputs.

When set to ``yes'', as is the case by default, the GC keeps
derivations---i.e., @code{.drv} files---as long as at least one of their
outputs is live.  This allows users to keep track of the origins of
items in their store.  Setting it to ``no'' saves a bit of disk space.

In this way, setting @code{--gc-keep-derivations} to ``yes'' causes liveness
to flow from outputs to derivations, and setting @code{--gc-keep-outputs} to
``yes'' causes liveness to flow from derivations to outputs.  When both are
set to ``yes'', the effect is to keep all the build prerequisites (the
sources, compiler, libraries, and other build-time tools) of live objects in
the store, regardless of whether these prerequisites are reachable from a GC
root.  This is convenient for developers since it saves rebuilds or downloads.

@item --impersonate-linux-2.6
On Linux-based systems, impersonate Linux 2.6.  This means that the
kernel's @code{uname} system call will report 2.6 as the release number.

This might be helpful to build programs that (usually wrongfully) depend
on the kernel version number.

@item --lose-logs
Do not keep build logs.  By default they are kept under
@code{@var{localstatedir}/guix/log}.

@item --system=@var{system}
Assume @var{system} as the current system type.  By default it is the
architecture/kernel pair found at configure time, such as
@code{x86_64-linux}.

@item --listen=@var{endpoint}
Listen for connections on @var{endpoint}.  @var{endpoint} is interpreted
as the file name of a Unix-domain socket if it starts with
@code{/} (slash sign).  Otherwise, @var{endpoint} is interpreted as a
host name or host name and port to listen to.  Here are a few examples:

@table @code
@item --listen=/gnu/var/daemon
Listen for connections on the @file{/gnu/var/daemon} Unix-domain socket,
creating it if needed.

@item --listen=localhost
@cindex daemon, remote access
@cindex remote access to the daemon
@cindex daemon, cluster setup
@cindex clusters, daemon setup
Listen for TCP connections on the network interface corresponding to
@code{localhost}, on port 44146.

@item --listen=128.0.0.42:1234
Listen for TCP connections on the network interface corresponding to
@code{128.0.0.42}, on port 1234.
@end table

This option can be repeated multiple times, in which case
@command{guix-daemon} accepts connections on all the specified
endpoints.  Users can tell client commands what endpoint to connect to
by setting the @code{GUIX_DAEMON_SOCKET} environment variable
(@pxref{The Store, @code{GUIX_DAEMON_SOCKET}}).

@quotation Note
The daemon protocol is @emph{unauthenticated and unencrypted}.  Using
@code{--listen=@var{host}} is suitable on local networks, such as
clusters, where only trusted nodes may connect to the build daemon.  In
other cases where remote access to the daemon is needed, we recommend
using Unix-domain sockets along with SSH.
@end quotation

When @code{--listen} is omitted, @command{guix-daemon} listens for
connections on the Unix-domain socket located at
@file{@var{localstatedir}/guix/daemon-socket/socket}.
@end table


@node Application Setup
@section Application Setup

@cindex foreign distro
When using Guix on top of GNU/Linux distribution other than Guix System---a
so-called @dfn{foreign distro}---a few additional steps are needed to
get everything in place.  Here are some of them.

@subsection Locales

@anchor{locales-and-locpath}
@cindex locales, when not on Guix System
@vindex LOCPATH
@vindex GUIX_LOCPATH
Packages installed @i{via} Guix will not use the locale data of the
host system.  Instead, you must first install one of the locale packages
available with Guix and then define the @code{GUIX_LOCPATH} environment
variable:

@example
$ guix package -i glibc-locales
$ export GUIX_LOCPATH=$HOME/.guix-profile/lib/locale
@end example

Note that the @code{glibc-locales} package contains data for all the
locales supported by the GNU@tie{}libc and weighs in at around
110@tie{}MiB.  Alternatively, the @code{glibc-utf8-locales} is smaller but
limited to a few UTF-8 locales.

The @code{GUIX_LOCPATH} variable plays a role similar to @code{LOCPATH}
(@pxref{Locale Names, @code{LOCPATH},, libc, The GNU C Library Reference
Manual}).  There are two important differences though:

@enumerate
@item
@code{GUIX_LOCPATH} is honored only by the libc in Guix, and not by the libc
provided by foreign distros.  Thus, using @code{GUIX_LOCPATH} allows you
to make sure the programs of the foreign distro will not end up loading
incompatible locale data.

@item
libc suffixes each entry of @code{GUIX_LOCPATH} with @code{/X.Y}, where
@code{X.Y} is the libc version---e.g., @code{2.22}.  This means that,
should your Guix profile contain a mixture of programs linked against
different libc version, each libc version will only try to load locale
data in the right format.
@end enumerate

This is important because the locale data format used by different libc
versions may be incompatible.

@subsection Name Service Switch

@cindex name service switch, glibc
@cindex NSS (name service switch), glibc
@cindex nscd (name service caching daemon)
@cindex name service caching daemon (nscd)
When using Guix on a foreign distro, we @emph{strongly recommend} that
the system run the GNU C library's @dfn{name service cache daemon},
@command{nscd}, which should be listening on the
@file{/var/run/nscd/socket} socket.  Failing to do that, applications
installed with Guix may fail to look up host names or user accounts, or
may even crash.  The next paragraphs explain why.

@cindex @file{nsswitch.conf}
The GNU C library implements a @dfn{name service switch} (NSS), which is
an extensible mechanism for ``name lookups'' in general: host name
resolution, user accounts, and more (@pxref{Name Service Switch,,, libc,
The GNU C Library Reference Manual}).

@cindex Network information service (NIS)
@cindex NIS (Network information service)
Being extensible, the NSS supports @dfn{plugins}, which provide new name
lookup implementations: for example, the @code{nss-mdns} plugin allow
resolution of @code{.local} host names, the @code{nis} plugin allows
user account lookup using the Network information service (NIS), and so
on.  These extra ``lookup services'' are configured system-wide in
@file{/etc/nsswitch.conf}, and all the programs running on the system
honor those settings (@pxref{NSS Configuration File,,, libc, The GNU C
Reference Manual}).

When they perform a name lookup---for instance by calling the
@code{getaddrinfo} function in C---applications first try to connect to
the nscd; on success, nscd performs name lookups on their behalf.  If
the nscd is not running, then they perform the name lookup by
themselves, by loading the name lookup services into their own address
space and running it.  These name lookup services---the
@file{libnss_*.so} files---are @code{dlopen}'d, but they may come from
the host system's C library, rather than from the C library the
application is linked against (the C library coming from Guix).

And this is where the problem is: if your application is linked against
Guix's C library (say, glibc 2.24) and tries to load NSS plugins from
another C library (say, @code{libnss_mdns.so} for glibc 2.22), it will
likely crash or have its name lookups fail unexpectedly.

Running @command{nscd} on the system, among other advantages, eliminates
this binary incompatibility problem because those @code{libnss_*.so}
files are loaded in the @command{nscd} process, not in applications
themselves.

@subsection X11 Fonts

@cindex fonts
The majority of graphical applications use Fontconfig to locate and
load fonts and perform X11-client-side rendering.  The @code{fontconfig}
package in Guix looks for fonts in @file{$HOME/.guix-profile}
by default.  Thus, to allow graphical applications installed with Guix
to display fonts, you have to install fonts with Guix as well.
Essential font packages include @code{gs-fonts}, @code{font-dejavu}, and
@code{font-gnu-freefont-ttf}.

To display text written in Chinese languages, Japanese, or Korean in
graphical applications, consider installing
@code{font-adobe-source-han-sans} or @code{font-wqy-zenhei}.  The former
has multiple outputs, one per language family (@pxref{Packages with
Multiple Outputs}).  For instance, the following command installs fonts
for Chinese languages:

@example
guix package -i font-adobe-source-han-sans:cn
@end example

@cindex @code{xterm}
Older programs such as @command{xterm} do not use Fontconfig and instead
rely on server-side font rendering.  Such programs require to specify a
full name of a font using XLFD (X Logical Font Description), like this:

@example
-*-dejavu sans-medium-r-normal-*-*-100-*-*-*-*-*-1
@end example

To be able to use such full names for the TrueType fonts installed in
your Guix profile, you need to extend the font path of the X server:

@c Note: 'xset' does not accept symlinks so the trick below arranges to
@c get at the real directory.  See <https://bugs.gnu.org/30655>.
@example
xset +fp $(dirname $(readlink -f ~/.guix-profile/share/fonts/truetype/fonts.dir))
@end example

@cindex @code{xlsfonts}
After that, you can run @code{xlsfonts} (from @code{xlsfonts} package)
to make sure your TrueType fonts are listed there.

@cindex @code{fc-cache}
@cindex font cache
After installing fonts you may have to refresh the font cache to use
them in applications.  The same applies when applications installed via
Guix do not seem to find fonts.  To force rebuilding of the font cache
run @code{fc-cache -f}.  The @code{fc-cache} command is provided by the
@code{fontconfig} package.

@subsection X.509 Certificates

@cindex @code{nss-certs}
The @code{nss-certs} package provides X.509 certificates, which allow
programs to authenticate Web servers accessed over HTTPS.

When using Guix on a foreign distro, you can install this package and
define the relevant environment variables so that packages know where to
look for certificates.  @xref{X.509 Certificates}, for detailed
information.

@subsection Emacs Packages

@cindex @code{emacs}
When you install Emacs packages with Guix, the elisp files may be placed
either in @file{$HOME/.guix-profile/share/emacs/site-lisp/} or in
sub-directories of
@file{$HOME/.guix-profile/share/emacs/site-lisp/guix.d/}.  The latter
directory exists because potentially there may exist thousands of Emacs
packages and storing all their files in a single directory may not be
reliable (because of name conflicts).  So we think using a separate
directory for each package is a good idea.  It is very similar to how
the Emacs package system organizes the file structure (@pxref{Package
Files,,, emacs, The GNU Emacs Manual}).

By default, Emacs (installed with Guix) ``knows'' where these packages
are placed, so you do not need to perform any configuration.  If, for
some reason, you want to avoid auto-loading Emacs packages installed
with Guix, you can do so by running Emacs with @code{--no-site-file}
option (@pxref{Init File,,, emacs, The GNU Emacs Manual}).

@subsection The GCC toolchain

@cindex GCC
@cindex ld-wrapper

Guix offers individual compiler packages such as @code{gcc} but if you
are in need of a complete toolchain for compiling and linking source
code what you really want is the @code{gcc-toolchain} package.  This
package provides a complete GCC toolchain for C/C++ development,
including GCC itself, the GNU C Library (headers and binaries, plus
debugging symbols in the @code{debug} output), Binutils, and a linker
wrapper.

The wrapper's purpose is to inspect the @code{-L} and @code{-l} switches
passed to the linker, add corresponding @code{-rpath} arguments, and
invoke the actual linker with this new set of arguments.  You can instruct the
wrapper to refuse to link against libraries not in the store by setting the
@code{GUIX_LD_WRAPPER_ALLOW_IMPURITIES} environment variable to @code{no}.

@node Limitations
@section Limitations

As of version @value{VERSION}, Guix System is
not production-ready.  It may contain bugs and lack important
features.  Thus, if you are looking for a stable production system that
respects your freedom as a computer user, a good solution at this point
is to consider @url{http://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html, one of
the more established GNU/Linux distributions}.  We hope you can soon switch
to the Guix System without fear, of course.  In the meantime, you can
also keep using your distribution and try out the package manager on top
of it (@pxref{Installation}).

Before you proceed with the installation, be aware of the following
noteworthy limitations applicable to version @value{VERSION}:

@itemize
@item
The installation process does not include a graphical user interface and
requires familiarity with GNU/Linux (see the following subsections to
get a feel of what that means.)

@item
Support for the Logical Volume Manager (LVM) is missing.

@item
More and more system services are provided (@pxref{Services}), but some
may be missing.

@item
More than 8,500 packages are available, but you might
occasionally find that a useful package is missing.

@item
GNOME, Xfce, LXDE, and Enlightenment are available (@pxref{Desktop Services}),
as well as a number of X11 window managers.  However, some graphical
applications may be missing, as well as KDE.

@xref{Contributing}, for more info.


@node Hardware Considerations
@section Hardware Considerations

@cindex hardware support on Guix System
GNU@tie{}Guix focuses on respecting the user's computing freedom.  It
builds around the kernel Linux-libre, which means that only hardware for
which free software drivers and firmware exist is supported.  Nowadays,
a wide range of off-the-shelf hardware is supported on
GNU/Linux-libre---from keyboards to graphics cards to scanners and
Ethernet controllers.  Unfortunately, there are still areas where
hardware vendors deny users control over their own computing, and such
hardware is not supported on Guix System.

@cindex WiFi, hardware support
One of the main areas where free drivers or firmware are lacking is WiFi
devices.  WiFi devices known to work include those using Atheros chips
(AR9271 and AR7010), which corresponds to the @code{ath9k} Linux-libre
driver, and those using Broadcom/AirForce chips (BCM43xx with
Wireless-Core Revision 5), which corresponds to the @code{b43-open}
Linux-libre driver.  Free firmware exists for both and is available
out-of-the-box on Guix System, as part of @var{%base-firmware}
(@pxref{operating-system Reference, @code{firmware}}).

@cindex RYF, Respects Your Freedom
The @uref{https://www.fsf.org/, Free Software Foundation} runs
@uref{https://www.fsf.org/ryf, @dfn{Respects Your Freedom}} (RYF), a
certification program for hardware products that respect your freedom
and your privacy and ensure that you have control over your device.  We
encourage you to check the list of RYF-certified devices.

Another useful resource is the @uref{https://www.h-node.org/, H-Node}

about their support in GNU/Linux.


@node USB Stick and DVD Installation
@section USB Stick and DVD Installation

where @var{system} is one of:

@table @code
@item x86_64-linux

@item i686-linux
for a 32-bit GNU/Linux system on Intel-compatible CPUs.
@end table

@c start duplication of authentication part from ``Binary Installation''
Make sure to download the associated @file{.sig} file and to verify the

@example
$ wget https://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/guix/guix-system-install-@value{VERSION}.@var{system}.iso.xz.sig
$ gpg --verify guix-system-install-@value{VERSION}.@var{system}.iso.xz.sig
@end example

If that command fails because you do not have the required public key,
then run this command to import it:

@example
$ gpg --keyserver @value{KEY-SERVER} \
      --recv-keys @value{OPENPGP-SIGNING-KEY-ID}
@end example

@noindent
and rerun the @code{gpg --verify} command.
@c end duplication

This image contains the tools necessary for an installation.
It is meant to be copied @emph{as is} to a large-enough USB stick or DVD.

@unnumberedsubsec Copying to a USB Stick

To copy the image to a USB stick, follow these steps:

@enumerate
@item
Decompress the image using the @command{xz} command:

@example
xz -d guix-system-install-@value{VERSION}.@var{system}.iso.xz
@end example

@item
Insert a USB stick of 1@tie{}GiB or more into your machine, and determine
its device name.  Assuming that the USB stick is known as @file{/dev/sdX},
copy the image with:

@example
dd if=guix-system-install-@value{VERSION}.@var{system}.iso of=/dev/sdX
sync
@end example

Access to @file{/dev/sdX} usually requires root privileges.
@end enumerate

@unnumberedsubsec Burning on a DVD

To copy the image to a DVD, follow these steps:

@enumerate
@item
Decompress the image using the @command{xz} command:

@example
xz -d guix-system-install-@value{VERSION}.@var{system}.iso.xz
@end example

@item
Insert a blank DVD into your machine, and determine
its device name.  Assuming that the DVD drive is known as @file{/dev/srX},
copy the image with:

@example
growisofs -dvd-compat -Z /dev/srX=guix-system-install-@value{VERSION}.@var{system}.iso
@end example

Access to @file{/dev/srX} usually requires root privileges.
@end enumerate

@unnumberedsubsec Booting

Once this is done, you should be able to reboot the system and boot from
the USB stick or DVD.  The latter usually requires you to get in the
BIOS or UEFI boot menu, where you can choose to boot from the USB stick.

@xref{Installing Guix in a VM}, if, instead, you would like to install
Guix System in a virtual machine (VM).


@node Preparing for Installation
@section Preparing for Installation

Once you have booted, you can use the guided graphical installer, which makes
it easy to get started (@pxref{Guided Graphical Installation}).  Alternately,
if you are already familiar with GNU/Linux and if you want more control than
what the graphical installer provides, you can choose the ``manual''
installation process (@pxref{Manual Installation}).

The graphical installer is available on TTY1.  You can obtain root shells on
TTYs 3 to 6 by hitting @kbd{ctrl-alt-f3}, @kbd{ctrl-alt-f4}, etc.  TTY2 shows
this documentation and you can reach it with @kbd{ctrl-alt-f2}.  Documentation
is browsable using the Info reader commands (@pxref{Top,,, info-stnd,
Stand-alone GNU Info}).  The installation system runs the GPM mouse daemon,
which allows you to select text with the left mouse button and to paste it
with the middle button.

@quotation Note
Installation requires access to the Internet so that any missing
dependencies of your system configuration can be downloaded.  See the
``Networking'' section below.
@end quotation

@node Guided Graphical Installation
@section Guided Graphical Installation

The graphical installer is a text-based user interface.  It will guide you,
with dialog boxes, through the steps needed to install GNU@tie{}Guix System.

The first dialog boxes allow you to set up the system as you use it during the
installation: you can choose the language, keyboard layout, and set up
networking, which will be used during the installation.  The image below shows
the networking dialog.

@image{images/installer-network,5in,, networking setup with the graphical installer}

Later steps allow you to partition your hard disk, as shown in the image
below, to choose whether or not to use encrypted file systems, to enter the
host name and root password, and to create an additional account, among other
things.

@image{images/installer-partitions,5in,, partitioning with the graphical installer}

Note that, at any time, the installer allows you to exit the current
installation step and resume at a previous step, as show in the image below.

@image{images/installer-resume,5in,, resuming the installation process}

Once you're done, the installer produces an operating system configuration and
displays it (@pxref{Using the Configuration System}).  At that point you can
hit ``OK'' and installation will proceed.  On success, you can reboot into the
new system and enjoy.  @xref{After System Installation}, for what's next!


@node Manual Installation
@section Manual Installation

This section describes how you would ``manually'' install GNU@tie{}Guix System
on your machine.  This option requires familiarity with GNU/Linux, with the
shell, and with common administration tools.  If you think this is not for
you, consider using the guided graphical installer (@pxref{Guided Graphical
Installation}).

The installation system provides root shells on TTYs 3 to 6; press
@kbd{ctrl-alt-f3}, @kbd{ctrl-alt-f4}, and so on to reach them.  It includes
many common tools needed to install the system.  But it is also a full-blown
Guix System, which means that you can install additional packages, should you
need it, using @command{guix package} (@pxref{Invoking guix package}).

@subsection Keyboard Layout, Networking, and Partitioning

Before you can install the system, you may want to adjust the keyboard layout,
set up networking, and partition your target hard disk.  This section will
guide you through this.

@subsubsection Keyboard Layout

@cindex keyboard layout
The installation image uses the US qwerty keyboard layout.  If you want
to change it, you can use the @command{loadkeys} command.  For example,
the following command selects the Dvorak keyboard layout:

@example
loadkeys dvorak
@end example

See the files under @file{/run/current-system/profile/share/keymaps} for
a list of available keyboard layouts.  Run @command{man loadkeys} for
more information.

@subsubsection Networking

Run the following command to see what your network interfaces are called:

@example
ifconfig -a
@end example

@noindent
@dots{} or, using the GNU/Linux-specific @command{ip} command:

@example
ip a
@end example

@c http://cgit.freedesktop.org/systemd/systemd/tree/src/udev/udev-builtin-net_id.c#n20
Wired interfaces have a name starting with @samp{e}; for example, the
interface corresponding to the first on-board Ethernet controller is
called @samp{eno1}.  Wireless interfaces have a name starting with
@samp{w}, like @samp{w1p2s0}.

@table @asis
@item Wired connection
To configure a wired network run the following command, substituting
@var{interface} with the name of the wired interface you want to use.

@example
ifconfig @var{interface} up
@end example

@item Wireless connection
@cindex wireless
@cindex WiFi
To configure wireless networking, you can create a configuration file
for the @command{wpa_supplicant} configuration tool (its location is not
important) using one of the available text editors such as
@command{nano}:

@example
nano wpa_supplicant.conf
@end example

As an example, the following stanza can go to this file and will work
for many wireless networks, provided you give the actual SSID and
passphrase for the network you are connecting to:

@example
network=@{
  ssid="@var{my-ssid}"
  key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
  psk="the network's secret passphrase"
@}
@end example

Start the wireless service and run it in the background with the
following command (substitute @var{interface} with the name of the
network interface you want to use):

@example
wpa_supplicant -c wpa_supplicant.conf -i @var{interface} -B
@end example

Run @command{man wpa_supplicant} for more information.
@end table

@cindex DHCP
At this point, you need to acquire an IP address.  On a network where IP
addresses are automatically assigned @i{via} DHCP, you can run:

@example
dhclient -v @var{interface}
@end example

Try to ping a server to see if networking is up and running:

@example
ping -c 3 gnu.org
@end example

Setting up network access is almost always a requirement because the
image does not contain all the software and tools that may be needed.

@cindex installing over SSH
If you want to, you can continue the installation remotely by starting
an SSH server:

@example
herd start ssh-daemon
@end example

Make sure to either set a password with @command{passwd}, or configure
OpenSSH public key authentication before logging in.

@subsubsection Disk Partitioning

Unless this has already been done, the next step is to partition, and
then format the target partition(s).

The installation image includes several partitioning tools, including
Parted (@pxref{Overview,,, parted, GNU Parted User Manual}),
@command{fdisk}, and @command{cfdisk}.  Run it and set up your disk with
the partition layout you want:

@example
cfdisk
@end example

If your disk uses the GUID Partition Table (GPT) format and you plan to
install BIOS-based GRUB (which is the default), make sure a BIOS Boot
Partition is available (@pxref{BIOS installation,,, grub, GNU GRUB
manual}).

@cindex EFI, installation
@cindex UEFI, installation
@cindex ESP, EFI system partition
If you instead wish to use EFI-based GRUB, a FAT32 @dfn{EFI System Partition}
(ESP) is required.  This partition can be mounted at @file{/boot/efi} for
instance and must have the @code{esp} flag set.  E.g., for @command{parted}:

@example
parted /dev/sda set 1 esp on
@end example

@quotation Note
@vindex grub-bootloader
@vindex grub-efi-bootloader
Unsure whether to use EFI- or BIOS-based GRUB?  If the directory
@file{/sys/firmware/efi} exists in the installation image, then you should
probably perform an EFI installation, using @code{grub-efi-bootloader}.
Otherwise you should use the BIOS-based GRUB, known as
@code{grub-bootloader}.  @xref{Bootloader Configuration}, for more info on
bootloaders.
@end quotation

Once you are done partitioning the target hard disk drive, you have to
create a file system on the relevant partition(s)@footnote{Currently
Guix System only supports ext4 and btrfs file systems.  In particular, code
that reads file system UUIDs and labels only works for these file system
types.}.  For the ESP, if you have one and assuming it is
@file{/dev/sda1}, run:

@example
mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/sda1
@end example

Preferably, assign file systems a label so that you can easily and
reliably refer to them in @code{file-system} declarations (@pxref{File
Systems}).  This is typically done using the @code{-L} option of
@command{mkfs.ext4} and related commands.  So, assuming the target root
partition lives at @file{/dev/sda2}, a file system with the label
@code{my-root} can be created with:

@example
mkfs.ext4 -L my-root /dev/sda2
@end example

@cindex encrypted disk
If you are instead planning to encrypt the root partition, you can use
the Cryptsetup/LUKS utilities to do that (see @inlinefmtifelse{html,
@uref{https://linux.die.net/man/8/cryptsetup, @code{man cryptsetup}},
@code{man cryptsetup}} for more information.)  Assuming you want to
store the root partition on @file{/dev/sda2}, the command sequence would
be along these lines:

@example
cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sda2
cryptsetup open --type luks /dev/sda2 my-partition
mkfs.ext4 -L my-root /dev/mapper/my-partition
@end example

Once that is done, mount the target file system under @file{/mnt}
with a command like (again, assuming @code{my-root} is the label of the
root file system):

@example
mount LABEL=my-root /mnt
@end example

Also mount any other file systems you would like to use on the target
system relative to this path.  If you have opted for @file{/boot/efi} as an
EFI mount point for example, mount it at @file{/mnt/boot/efi} now so it is
found by @code{guix system init} afterwards.

Finally, if you plan to use one or more swap partitions (@pxref{Memory
Concepts, swap space,, libc, The GNU C Library Reference Manual}), make
sure to initialize them with @command{mkswap}.  Assuming you have one
swap partition on @file{/dev/sda3}, you would run:

@example
mkswap /dev/sda3
swapon /dev/sda3
@end example

Alternatively, you may use a swap file.  For example, assuming that in
the new system you want to use the file @file{/swapfile} as a swap file,
you would run@footnote{This example will work for many types of file
systems (e.g., ext4).  However, for copy-on-write file systems (e.g.,
btrfs), the required steps may be different.  For details, see the
manual pages for @command{mkswap} and @command{swapon}.}:

@example
# This is 10 GiB of swap space.  Adjust "count" to change the size.
dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/swapfile bs=1MiB count=10240
# For security, make the file readable and writable only by root.
chmod 600 /mnt/swapfile
mkswap /mnt/swapfile
swapon /mnt/swapfile
@end example

Note that if you have encrypted the root partition and created a swap
file in its file system as described above, then the encryption also
protects the swap file, just like any other file in that file system.

@node Proceeding with the Installation
@subsection Proceeding with the Installation

With the target partitions ready and the target root mounted on
@file{/mnt}, we're ready to go.  First, run:

@example
herd start cow-store /mnt
@end example

This makes @file{/gnu/store} copy-on-write, such that packages added to it
during the installation phase are written to the target disk on @file{/mnt}
rather than kept in memory.  This is necessary because the first phase of
the @command{guix system init} command (see below) entails downloads or
builds to @file{/gnu/store} which, initially, is an in-memory file system.

Next, you have to edit a file and
provide the declaration of the operating system to be installed.  To
that end, the installation system comes with three text editors.  We
recommend GNU nano (@pxref{Top,,, nano, GNU nano Manual}), which
supports syntax highlighting and parentheses matching; other editors
include GNU Zile (an Emacs clone), and
nvi (a clone of the original BSD @command{vi} editor).
We strongly recommend storing that file on the target root file system, say,
as @file{/mnt/etc/config.scm}.  Failing to do that, you will have lost your
configuration file once you have rebooted into the newly-installed system.

@xref{Using the Configuration System}, for an overview of the
configuration file.  The example configurations discussed in that
section are available under @file{/etc/configuration} in the
installation image.  Thus, to get started with a system configuration
providing a graphical display server (a ``desktop'' system), you can run
something along these lines:

@example
# mkdir /mnt/etc
# cp /etc/configuration/desktop.scm /mnt/etc/config.scm
# nano /mnt/etc/config.scm
@end example

You should pay attention to what your configuration file contains, and
in particular:

@itemize
@item
Make sure the @code{bootloader-configuration} form refers to the target
you want to install GRUB on.  It should mention @code{grub-bootloader} if
you are installing GRUB in the legacy way, or @code{grub-efi-bootloader}
for newer UEFI systems.  For legacy systems, the @code{target} field
names a device, like @code{/dev/sda}; for UEFI systems it names a path
to a mounted EFI partition, like @code{/boot/efi}; do make sure the path is
currently mounted and a @code{file-system} entry is specified in your
configuration.

@item
Be sure that your file system labels match the value of their respective
@code{device} fields in your @code{file-system} configuration, assuming
your @code{file-system} configuration uses the @code{file-system-label}
procedure in its @code{device} field.

@item
If there are encrypted or RAID partitions, make sure to add a
@code{mapped-devices} field to describe them (@pxref{Mapped Devices}).
@end itemize

Once you are done preparing the configuration file, the new system must
be initialized (remember that the target root file system is mounted
under @file{/mnt}):

@example
guix system init /mnt/etc/config.scm /mnt
@end example

@noindent
This copies all the necessary files and installs GRUB on
@file{/dev/sdX}, unless you pass the @option{--no-bootloader} option.  For
more information, @pxref{Invoking guix system}.  This command may trigger
downloads or builds of missing packages, which can take some time.

Once that command has completed---and hopefully succeeded!---you can run
@command{reboot} and boot into the new system.  The @code{root} password
in the new system is initially empty; other users' passwords need to be
initialized by running the @command{passwd} command as @code{root},
unless your configuration specifies otherwise
(@pxref{user-account-password, user account passwords}).
@xref{After System Installation}, for what's next!


@node After System Installation
@section After System Installation

Success, you've now booted into Guix System!  From then on, you can update the
system whenever you want by running, say:

@example
guix pull
sudo guix system reconfigure /etc/config.scm
@end example

@noindent
This builds a new system generation with the latest packages and services
(@pxref{Invoking guix system}).  We recommend doing that regularly so that
your system includes the latest security updates (@pxref{Security Updates}).

@c See <https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/guix-devel/2019-01/msg00268.html>.
@quotation Note
@cindex sudo vs. @command{guix pull}
Note that @command{sudo guix} runs your user's @command{guix} command and
@emph{not} root's, because @command{sudo} leaves @code{PATH} unchanged.  To
explicitly run root's @command{guix}, type @command{sudo -i guix @dots{}}.

@node Installing Guix in a VM
@section Installing Guix in a Virtual Machine

@cindex virtual machine, Guix System installation
@cindex virtual private server (VPS)
@cindex VPS (virtual private server)
If you'd like to install Guix System in a virtual machine (VM) or on a
virtual private server (VPS) rather than on your beloved machine, this
section is for you.

To boot a @uref{http://qemu.org/,QEMU} VM for installing Guix System in a
disk image, follow these steps:

@enumerate
@item
First, retrieve and decompress the Guix system installation image as
described previously (@pxref{USB Stick and DVD Installation}).

@item
Create a disk image that will hold the installed system.  To make a
qcow2-formatted disk image, use the @command{qemu-img} command:

@example
qemu-img create -f qcow2 guixsd.img 50G
@end example

The resulting file will be much smaller than 50 GB (typically less than
1 MB), but it will grow as the virtualized storage device is filled up.

@item
Boot the USB installation image in an VM:

@example
qemu-system-x86_64 -m 1024 -smp 1 \
  -net user -net nic,model=virtio -boot menu=on \
  -drive file=guix-system-install-@value{VERSION}.@var{system}.iso \
  -drive file=guixsd.img
@end example

The ordering of the drives matters.

In the VM console, quickly press the @kbd{F12} key to enter the boot
menu.  Then press the @kbd{2} key and the @kbd{RET} key to validate your
selection.

@item
You're now root in the VM, proceed with the installation process.
@xref{Preparing for Installation}, and follow the instructions.
@end enumerate

Once installation is complete, you can boot the system that's on your
@file{guixsd.img} image.  @xref{Running Guix in a VM}, for how to do
that.

@node Building the Installation Image
@section Building the Installation Image

@cindex installation image
The installation image described above was built using the @command{guix
system} command, specifically:

@example
guix system disk-image --file-system-type=iso9660 \
  gnu/system/install.scm
@end example

Have a look at @file{gnu/system/install.scm} in the source tree,
and see also @ref{Invoking guix system} for more information
about the installation image.

@section Building the Installation Image for ARM Boards

Many ARM boards require a specific variant of the
@uref{http://www.denx.de/wiki/U-Boot/, U-Boot} bootloader.

If you build a disk image and the bootloader is not available otherwise
(on another boot drive etc), it's advisable to build an image that
includes the bootloader, specifically:

@example
guix system disk-image --system=armhf-linux -e '((@@ (gnu system install) os-with-u-boot) (@@ (gnu system install) installation-os) "A20-OLinuXino-Lime2")'
@end example

@code{A20-OLinuXino-Lime2} is the name of the board.  If you specify an invalid
board, a list of possible boards will be printed.

@node Package Management
@chapter Package Management

@cindex packages
The purpose of GNU Guix is to allow users to easily install, upgrade, and
remove software packages, without having to know about their build
procedures or dependencies.  Guix also goes beyond this obvious set of
features.

This chapter describes the main features of Guix, as well as the
package management tools it provides.  Along with the command-line
interface described below (@pxref{Invoking guix package, @code{guix
package}}), you may also use the Emacs-Guix interface (@pxref{Top,,,
emacs-guix, The Emacs-Guix Reference Manual}), after installing
@code{emacs-guix} package (run @kbd{M-x guix-help} command to start
with it):

@example
guix package -i emacs-guix

@node Features
@section Features

When using Guix, each package ends up in the @dfn{package store}, in its
own directory---something that resembles
@file{/gnu/store/xxx-package-1.2}, where @code{xxx} is a base32 string.

Instead of referring to these directories, users have their own
@dfn{profile}, which points to the packages that they actually want to
use.  These profiles are stored within each user's home directory, at
@code{$HOME/.guix-profile}.

For example, @code{alice} installs GCC 4.7.2.  As a result,
@file{/home/alice/.guix-profile/bin/gcc} points to
@file{/gnu/store/@dots{}-gcc-4.7.2/bin/gcc}.  Now, on the same machine,
@code{bob} had already installed GCC 4.8.0.  The profile of @code{bob}
simply continues to point to
@file{/gnu/store/@dots{}-gcc-4.8.0/bin/gcc}---i.e., both versions of GCC
coexist on the same system without any interference.

The @command{guix package} command is the central tool to manage
packages (@pxref{Invoking guix package}).  It operates on the per-user
profiles, and can be used @emph{with normal user privileges}.

@cindex transactions
The command provides the obvious install, remove, and upgrade
operations.  Each invocation is actually a @emph{transaction}: either
the specified operation succeeds, or nothing happens.  Thus, if the
@command{guix package} process is terminated during the transaction,
or if a power outage occurs during the transaction, then the user's
profile remains in its previous state, and remains usable.

In addition, any package transaction may be @emph{rolled back}.  So, if,
for example, an upgrade installs a new version of a package that turns
out to have a serious bug, users may roll back to the previous instance
of their profile, which was known to work well.  Similarly, the global
system configuration on Guix is subject to
transactional upgrades and roll-back
(@pxref{Using the Configuration System}).

All packages in the package store may be @emph{garbage-collected}.
Guix can determine which packages are still referenced by user
profiles, and remove those that are provably no longer referenced
(@pxref{Invoking guix gc}).  Users may also explicitly remove old
generations of their profile so that the packages they refer to can be
collected.

@cindex reproducibility
@cindex reproducible builds
Guix takes a @dfn{purely functional} approach to package
management, as described in the introduction (@pxref{Introduction}).
Each @file{/gnu/store} package directory name contains a hash of all the
inputs that were used to build that package---compiler, libraries, build
scripts, etc.  This direct correspondence allows users to make sure a
given package installation matches the current state of their
distribution.  It also helps maximize @dfn{build reproducibility}:
thanks to the isolated build environments that are used, a given build
is likely to yield bit-identical files when performed on different
machines (@pxref{Invoking guix-daemon, container}).

@cindex substitutes
This foundation allows Guix to support @dfn{transparent binary/source
deployment}.  When a pre-built binary for a @file{/gnu/store} item is
available from an external source---a @dfn{substitute}, Guix just
downloads it and unpacks it;
otherwise, it builds the package from source, locally
(@pxref{Substitutes}).  Because build results are usually bit-for-bit
reproducible, users do not have to trust servers that provide
substitutes: they can force a local build and @emph{challenge} providers
(@pxref{Invoking guix challenge}).

Control over the build environment is a feature that is also useful for
developers.  The @command{guix environment} command allows developers of
a package to quickly set up the right development environment for their
package, without having to manually install the dependencies of the
package into their profile (@pxref{Invoking guix environment}).

@cindex replication, of software environments
@cindex provenance tracking, of software artifacts
All of Guix and its package definitions is version-controlled, and
@command{guix pull} allows you to ``travel in time'' on the history of Guix
itself (@pxref{Invoking guix pull}).  This makes it possible to replicate a
Guix instance on a different machine or at a later point in time, which in
turn allows you to @emph{replicate complete software environments}, while
retaining precise @dfn{provenance tracking} of the software.

@node Invoking guix package
@section Invoking @command{guix package}

@cindex installing packages
@cindex removing packages
@cindex package installation
@cindex package removal
The @command{guix package} command is the tool that allows users to
install, upgrade, and remove packages, as well as rolling back to
previous configurations.  It operates only on the user's own profile,
and works with normal user privileges (@pxref{Features}).  Its syntax
is:

@example
guix package @var{options}
@end example
@cindex transactions
Primarily, @var{options} specifies the operations to be performed during
the transaction.  Upon completion, a new profile is created, but
previous @dfn{generations} of the profile remain available, should the user
want to roll back.

For example, to remove @code{lua} and install @code{guile} and
@code{guile-cairo} in a single transaction:

@example
guix package -r lua -i guile guile-cairo
@end example

@command{guix package} also supports a @dfn{declarative approach}
whereby the user specifies the exact set of packages to be available and
passes it @i{via} the @option{--manifest} option
(@pxref{profile-manifest, @option{--manifest}}).

@cindex profile
For each user, a symlink to the user's default profile is automatically
created in @file{$HOME/.guix-profile}.  This symlink always points to the
current generation of the user's default profile.  Thus, users can add
@file{$HOME/.guix-profile/bin} to their @code{PATH} environment
variable, and so on.
@cindex search paths
If you are not using the Guix System Distribution, consider adding the
following lines to your @file{~/.bash_profile} (@pxref{Bash Startup
Files,,, bash, The GNU Bash Reference Manual}) so that newly-spawned
shells get all the right environment variable definitions:

@example
GUIX_PROFILE="$HOME/.guix-profile" ; \
source "$HOME/.guix-profile/etc/profile"
@end example

In a multi-user setup, user profiles are stored in a place registered as
a @dfn{garbage-collector root}, which @file{$HOME/.guix-profile} points
to (@pxref{Invoking guix gc}).  That directory is normally
@code{@var{localstatedir}/guix/profiles/per-user/@var{user}}, where
@var{localstatedir} is the value passed to @code{configure} as
@code{--localstatedir}, and @var{user} is the user name.  The
@file{per-user} directory is created when @command{guix-daemon} is
started, and the @var{user} sub-directory is created by @command{guix
package}.

The @var{options} can be among the following:

@table @code

@item --install=@var{package} @dots{}
@itemx -i @var{package} @dots{}
Install the specified @var{package}s.

Each @var{package} may specify either a simple package name, such as
@code{guile}, or a package name followed by an at-sign and version number,
such as @code{guile@@1.8.8} or simply @code{guile@@1.8} (in the latter
case, the newest version prefixed by @code{1.8} is selected.)

If no version number is specified, the
newest available version will be selected.  In addition, @var{package}
may contain a colon, followed by the name of one of the outputs of the
package, as in @code{gcc:doc} or @code{binutils@@2.22:lib}
(@pxref{Packages with Multiple Outputs}).  Packages with a corresponding
name (and optionally version) are searched for among the GNU
distribution modules (@pxref{Package Modules}).

@cindex propagated inputs
Sometimes packages have @dfn{propagated inputs}: these are dependencies
that automatically get installed along with the required package
(@pxref{package-propagated-inputs, @code{propagated-inputs} in
@code{package} objects}, for information about propagated inputs in
package definitions).

@anchor{package-cmd-propagated-inputs}
An example is the GNU MPC library: its C header files refer to those of
the GNU MPFR library, which in turn refer to those of the GMP library.
Thus, when installing MPC, the MPFR and GMP libraries also get installed
in the profile; removing MPC also removes MPFR and GMP---unless they had
also been explicitly installed by the user.

Besides, packages sometimes rely on the definition of environment
variables for their search paths (see explanation of
@code{--search-paths} below).  Any missing or possibly incorrect
environment variable definitions are reported here.

@item --install-from-expression=@var{exp}
@itemx -e @var{exp}
Install the package @var{exp} evaluates to.

@var{exp} must be a Scheme expression that evaluates to a
@code{<package>} object.  This option is notably useful to disambiguate
between same-named variants of a package, with expressions such as
@code{(@@ (gnu packages base) guile-final)}.

Note that this option installs the first output of the specified
package, which may be insufficient when needing a specific output of a
multiple-output package.

@item --install-from-file=@var{file}
@itemx -f @var{file}
Install the package that the code within @var{file} evaluates to.

As an example, @var{file} might contain a definition like this
(@pxref{Defining Packages}):

@example
@verbatiminclude package-hello.scm
@end example

Developers may find it useful to include such a @file{guix.scm} file
in the root of their project source tree that can be used to test
development snapshots and create reproducible development environments
(@pxref{Invoking guix environment}).

@item --remove=@var{package} @dots{}
@itemx -r @var{package} @dots{}
Remove the specified @var{package}s.

As for @code{--install}, each @var{package} may specify a version number
and/or output name in addition to the package name.  For instance,
@code{-r glibc:debug} would remove the @code{debug} output of
@code{glibc}.

@item --upgrade[=@var{regexp} @dots{}]
@itemx -u [@var{regexp} @dots{}]
@cindex upgrading packages
Upgrade all the installed packages.  If one or more @var{regexp}s are
specified, upgrade only installed packages whose name matches a
@var{regexp}.  Also see the @code{--do-not-upgrade} option below.

Note that this upgrades package to the latest version of packages found
in the distribution currently installed.  To update your distribution,
you should regularly run @command{guix pull} (@pxref{Invoking guix
pull}).

@item --do-not-upgrade[=@var{regexp} @dots{}]
When used together with the @code{--upgrade} option, do @emph{not}
upgrade any packages whose name matches a @var{regexp}.  For example, to
upgrade all packages in the current profile except those containing the
substring ``emacs'':

@example
$ guix package --upgrade . --do-not-upgrade emacs
@end example

@item @anchor{profile-manifest}--manifest=@var{file}
@itemx -m @var{file}
@cindex profile declaration
@cindex profile manifest
Create a new generation of the profile from the manifest object
returned by the Scheme code in @var{file}.

This allows you to @emph{declare} the profile's contents rather than
constructing it through a sequence of @code{--install} and similar
commands.  The advantage is that @var{file} can be put under version
control, copied to different machines to reproduce the same profile, and
so on.

@c FIXME: Add reference to (guix profile) documentation when available.
@var{file} must return a @dfn{manifest} object, which is roughly a list
of packages:

@findex packages->manifest
@example
(use-package-modules guile emacs)

(packages->manifest
 (list emacs
       guile-2.0
       ;; Use a specific package output.
       (list guile-2.0 "debug")))
@end example

@findex specifications->manifest
In this example we have to know which modules define the @code{emacs}
and @code{guile-2.0} variables to provide the right
@code{use-package-modules} line, which can be cumbersome.  We can
instead provide regular package specifications and let
@code{specifications->manifest} look up the corresponding package
objects, like this:

@example
(specifications->manifest
 '("emacs" "guile@@2.2" "guile@@2.2:debug"))
@end example

@item --roll-back
@cindex rolling back
@cindex undoing transactions
@cindex transactions, undoing
Roll back to the previous @dfn{generation} of the profile---i.e., undo
the last transaction.

When combined with options such as @code{--install}, roll back occurs
before any other actions.

When rolling back from the first generation that actually contains
installed packages, the profile is made to point to the @dfn{zeroth
generation}, which contains no files apart from its own metadata.

After having rolled back, installing, removing, or upgrading packages
overwrites previous future generations.  Thus, the history of the
generations in a profile is always linear.

@item --switch-generation=@var{pattern}
@itemx -S @var{pattern}
@cindex generations
Switch to a particular generation defined by @var{pattern}.

@var{pattern} may be either a generation number or a number prefixed
with ``+'' or ``-''.  The latter means: move forward/backward by a
specified number of generations.  For example, if you want to return to
the latest generation after @code{--roll-back}, use
@code{--switch-generation=+1}.

The difference between @code{--roll-back} and
@code{--switch-generation=-1} is that @code{--switch-generation} will
not make a zeroth generation, so if a specified generation does not
exist, the current generation will not be changed.

@item --search-paths[=@var{kind}]
@cindex search paths
Report environment variable definitions, in Bash syntax, that may be
needed in order to use the set of installed packages.  These environment
variables are used to specify @dfn{search paths} for files used by some
of the installed packages.

For example, GCC needs the @code{CPATH} and @code{LIBRARY_PATH}
environment variables to be defined so it can look for headers and
libraries in the user's profile (@pxref{Environment Variables,,, gcc,
Using the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)}).  If GCC and, say, the C
library are installed in the profile, then @code{--search-paths} will
suggest setting these variables to @code{@var{profile}/include} and
@code{@var{profile}/lib}, respectively.

The typical use case is to define these environment variables in the
shell:

@example
$ eval `guix package --search-paths`
@end example

@var{kind} may be one of @code{exact}, @code{prefix}, or @code{suffix},
meaning that the returned environment variable definitions will either
be exact settings, or prefixes or suffixes of the current value of these
variables.  When omitted, @var{kind} defaults to @code{exact}.

This option can also be used to compute the @emph{combined} search paths
of several profiles.  Consider this example:

@example
$ guix package -p foo -i guile
$ guix package -p bar -i guile-json
$ guix package -p foo -p bar --search-paths
@end example

The last command above reports about the @code{GUILE_LOAD_PATH}
variable, even though, taken individually, neither @file{foo} nor
@file{bar} would lead to that recommendation.


@item --profile=@var{profile}
@itemx -p @var{profile}
Use @var{profile} instead of the user's default profile.

@cindex collisions, in a profile
@cindex colliding packages in profiles
@cindex profile collisions
@item --allow-collisions
Allow colliding packages in the new profile.  Use at your own risk!

By default, @command{guix package} reports as an error @dfn{collisions}
in the profile.  Collisions happen when two or more different versions
or variants of a given package end up in the profile.

@item --bootstrap
Use the bootstrap Guile to build the profile.  This option is only
useful to distribution developers.

@end table

In addition to these actions, @command{guix package} supports the
following options to query the current state of a profile, or the
availability of packages:

@table @option

@item --search=@var{regexp}
@itemx -s @var{regexp}
@cindex searching for packages
List the available packages whose name, synopsis, or description matches
@var{regexp} (in a case-insensitive fashion), sorted by relevance.
Print all the metadata of matching packages in
@code{recutils} format (@pxref{Top, GNU recutils databases,, recutils,
GNU recutils manual}).

This allows specific fields to be extracted using the @command{recsel}
command, for instance:

@example
$ guix package -s malloc | recsel -p name,version,relevance
name: jemalloc
version: 4.5.0
relevance: 6

name: glibc
version: 2.25
relevance: 1

name: libgc
version: 7.6.0
relevance: 1
@end example

Similarly, to show the name of all the packages available under the
terms of the GNU@tie{}LGPL version 3:

@example
$ guix package -s "" | recsel -p name -e 'license ~ "LGPL 3"'
name: elfutils

name: gmp
@dots{}
@end example

It is also possible to refine search results using several @code{-s}
flags.  For example, the following command returns a list of board
games:

@example
$ guix package -s '\<board\>' -s game | recsel -p name
name: gnubg
@dots{}
@end example

If we were to omit @code{-s game}, we would also get software packages
that deal with printed circuit boards; removing the angle brackets
around @code{board} would further add packages that have to do with
keyboards.

And now for a more elaborate example.  The following command searches
for cryptographic libraries, filters out Haskell, Perl, Python, and Ruby
libraries, and prints the name and synopsis of the matching packages:

@example
$ guix package -s crypto -s library | \
    recsel -e '! (name ~ "^(ghc|perl|python|ruby)")' -p name,synopsis
@end example

@noindent
@xref{Selection Expressions,,, recutils, GNU recutils manual}, for more
information on @dfn{selection expressions} for @code{recsel -e}.

@item --show=@var{package}
Show details about @var{package}, taken from the list of available packages, in
@code{recutils} format (@pxref{Top, GNU recutils databases,, recutils, GNU
recutils manual}).

@example
$ guix package --show=python | recsel -p name,version
name: python
version: 2.7.6

name: python
version: 3.3.5
@end example

You may also specify the full name of a package to only get details about a
specific version of it:
@example
$ guix package --show=python@@3.4 | recsel -p name,version
name: python
version: 3.4.3
@end example



@item --list-installed[=@var{regexp}]
@itemx -I [@var{regexp}]
List the currently installed packages in the specified profile, with the
most recently installed packages shown last.  When @var{regexp} is
specified, list only installed packages whose name matches @var{regexp}.

For each installed package, print the following items, separated by
tabs: the package name, its version string, the part of the package that
is installed (for instance, @code{out} for the default output,
@code{include} for its headers, etc.), and the path of this package in
the store.

@item --list-available[=@var{regexp}]
@itemx -A [@var{regexp}]
List packages currently available in the distribution for this system
(@pxref{GNU Distribution}).  When @var{regexp} is specified, list only
installed packages whose name matches @var{regexp}.

For each package, print the following items separated by tabs: its name,
its version string, the parts of the package (@pxref{Packages with
Multiple Outputs}), and the source location of its definition.

@item --list-generations[=@var{pattern}]
@itemx -l [@var{pattern}]
@cindex generations
Return a list of generations along with their creation dates; for each
generation, show the installed packages, with the most recently
installed packages shown last.  Note that the zeroth generation is never
shown.

For each installed package, print the following items, separated by
tabs: the name of a package, its version string, the part of the package
that is installed (@pxref{Packages with Multiple Outputs}), and the
location of this package in the store.

When @var{pattern} is used, the command returns only matching
generations.  Valid patterns include:

@itemize
@item @emph{Integers and comma-separated integers}.  Both patterns denote
generation numbers.  For instance, @code{--list-generations=1} returns
the first one.

And @code{--list-generations=1,8,2} outputs three generations in the
specified order.  Neither spaces nor trailing commas are allowed.

@item @emph{Ranges}.  @code{--list-generations=2..9} prints the
specified generations and everything in between.  Note that the start of
a range must be smaller than its end.

It is also possible to omit the endpoint.  For example,
@code{--list-generations=2..}, returns all generations starting from the
second one.

@item @emph{Durations}.  You can also get the last @emph{N}@tie{}days, weeks,
or months by passing an integer along with the first letter of the
duration.  For example, @code{--list-generations=20d} lists generations
that are up to 20 days old.
@end itemize

@item --delete-generations[=@var{pattern}]
@itemx -d [@var{pattern}]
When @var{pattern} is omitted, delete all generations except the current
one.

This command accepts the same patterns as @option{--list-generations}.
When @var{pattern} is specified, delete the matching generations.  When
@var{pattern} specifies a duration, generations @emph{older} than the
specified duration match.  For instance, @code{--delete-generations=1m}
deletes generations that are more than one month old.

If the current generation matches, it is @emph{not} deleted.  Also, the
zeroth generation is never deleted.

Note that deleting generations prevents rolling back to them.
Consequently, this command must be used with care.

@end table

Finally, since @command{guix package} may actually start build
processes, it supports all the common build options (@pxref{Common Build
Options}).  It also supports package transformation options, such as
@option{--with-source} (@pxref{Package Transformation Options}).
However, note that package transformations are lost when upgrading; to
preserve transformations across upgrades, you should define your own
package variant in a Guile module and add it to @code{GUIX_PACKAGE_PATH}
(@pxref{Defining Packages}).

@node Substitutes
@section Substitutes

@cindex substitutes
@cindex pre-built binaries
Guix supports transparent source/binary deployment, which means that it
can either build things locally, or download pre-built items from a
server, or both.  We call these pre-built items @dfn{substitutes}---they
are substitutes for local build results.  In many cases, downloading a
substitute is much faster than building things locally.

Substitutes can be anything resulting from a derivation build
(@pxref{Derivations}).  Of course, in the common case, they are
pre-built package binaries, but source tarballs, for instance, which
also result from derivation builds, can be available as substitutes.

@node Official Substitute Server
@subsection Official Substitute Server

@cindex hydra
@cindex build farm
The @code{@value{SUBSTITUTE-SERVER}} server is a front-end to an official build farm
that builds packages from Guix continuously for some
architectures, and makes them available as substitutes.  This is the
default source of substitutes; it can be overridden by passing the
@option{--substitute-urls} option either to @command{guix-daemon}
(@pxref{daemon-substitute-urls,, @code{guix-daemon --substitute-urls}})
or to client tools such as @command{guix package}
(@pxref{client-substitute-urls,, client @option{--substitute-urls}
option}).

Substitute URLs can be either HTTP or HTTPS.
HTTPS is recommended because communications are encrypted; conversely,
using HTTP makes all communications visible to an eavesdropper, who
could use the information gathered to determine, for instance, whether
your system has unpatched security vulnerabilities.

Substitutes from the official build farm are enabled by default when
using the Guix System Distribution (@pxref{GNU Distribution}).  However,
they are disabled by default when using Guix on a foreign distribution,
unless you have explicitly enabled them via one of the recommended
installation steps (@pxref{Installation}).  The following paragraphs
describe how to enable or disable substitutes for the official build
farm; the same procedure can also be used to enable substitutes for any
other substitute server.

@node Substitute Server Authorization
@subsection Substitute Server Authorization

@cindex security
@cindex substitutes, authorization thereof
@cindex access control list (ACL), for substitutes
@cindex ACL (access control list), for substitutes
To allow Guix to download substitutes from @code{@value{SUBSTITUTE-SERVER}} or a
mirror thereof, you
must add its public key to the access control list (ACL) of archive
imports, using the @command{guix archive} command (@pxref{Invoking guix
archive}).  Doing so implies that you trust @code{@value{SUBSTITUTE-SERVER}} to not
be compromised and to serve genuine substitutes.

The public key for @code{@value{SUBSTITUTE-SERVER}} is installed along with Guix, in
@code{@var{prefix}/share/guix/@value{SUBSTITUTE-SERVER}.pub}, where @var{prefix} is
the installation prefix of Guix.  If you installed Guix from source,
make sure you checked the GPG signature of
@file{guix-@value{VERSION}.tar.gz}, which contains this public key file.
Then, you can run something like this:

@example
# guix archive --authorize < @var{prefix}/share/guix/@value{SUBSTITUTE-SERVER}.pub
@end example

@quotation Note
Similarly, the @file{hydra.gnu.org.pub} file contains the public key
of an independent build farm also run by the project, reachable at
@indicateurl{https://mirror.hydra.gnu.org}.
@end quotation

Once this is in place, the output of a command like @code{guix build}
should change from something like:

@example
$ guix build emacs --dry-run
The following derivations would be built:
   /gnu/store/yr7bnx8xwcayd6j95r2clmkdl1qh688w-emacs-24.3.drv
   /gnu/store/x8qsh1hlhgjx6cwsjyvybnfv2i37z23w-dbus-1.6.4.tar.gz.drv
   /gnu/store/1ixwp12fl950d15h2cj11c73733jay0z-alsa-lib-1.0.27.1.tar.bz2.drv
   /gnu/store/nlma1pw0p603fpfiqy7kn4zm105r5dmw-util-linux-2.21.drv
@dots{}
@end example

@noindent
to something like:

@example
$ guix build emacs --dry-run
112.3 MB would be downloaded:
   /gnu/store/pk3n22lbq6ydamyymqkkz7i69wiwjiwi-emacs-24.3
   /gnu/store/2ygn4ncnhrpr61rssa6z0d9x22si0va3-libjpeg-8d
   /gnu/store/71yz6lgx4dazma9dwn2mcjxaah9w77jq-cairo-1.12.16
   /gnu/store/7zdhgp0n1518lvfn8mb96sxqfmvqrl7v-libxrender-0.9.7
@dots{}
@end example

@noindent
This indicates that substitutes from @code{@value{SUBSTITUTE-SERVER}} are usable and
will be downloaded, when possible, for future builds.

@cindex substitutes, how to disable
The substitute mechanism can be disabled globally by running
@code{guix-daemon} with @code{--no-substitutes} (@pxref{Invoking
guix-daemon}).  It can also be disabled temporarily by passing the
@code{--no-substitutes} option to @command{guix package}, @command{guix
build}, and other command-line tools.

@node Substitute Authentication
@subsection Substitute Authentication

@cindex digital signatures
Guix detects and raises an error when attempting to use a substitute
that has been tampered with.  Likewise, it ignores substitutes that are
not signed, or that are not signed by one of the keys listed in the ACL.

There is one exception though: if an unauthorized server provides
substitutes that are @emph{bit-for-bit identical} to those provided by
an authorized server, then the unauthorized server becomes eligible for
downloads.  For example, assume we have chosen two substitute servers
with this option:

@example
--substitute-urls="https://a.example.org https://b.example.org"
@end example

@noindent
@cindex reproducible builds
If the ACL contains only the key for @code{b.example.org}, and if
@code{a.example.org} happens to serve the @emph{exact same} substitutes,
then Guix will download substitutes from @code{a.example.org} because it
comes first in the list and can be considered a mirror of
@code{b.example.org}.  In practice, independent build machines usually
produce the same binaries, thanks to bit-reproducible builds (see
below).

When using HTTPS, the server's X.509 certificate is @emph{not} validated
(in other words, the server is not authenticated), contrary to what
HTTPS clients such as Web browsers usually do.  This is because Guix
authenticates substitute information itself, as explained above, which
is what we care about (whereas X.509 certificates are about
authenticating bindings between domain names and public keys.)

@node Proxy Settings
@subsection Proxy Settings

@vindex http_proxy
Substitutes are downloaded over HTTP or HTTPS.
The @code{http_proxy} environment
variable can be set in the environment of @command{guix-daemon} and is
honored for downloads of substitutes.  Note that the value of
@code{http_proxy} in the environment where @command{guix build},
@command{guix package}, and other client commands are run has
@emph{absolutely no effect}.

@node Substitution Failure
@subsection Substitution Failure

Even when a substitute for a derivation is available, sometimes the
substitution attempt will fail.  This can happen for a variety of
reasons: the substitute server might be offline, the substitute may
recently have been deleted, the connection might have been interrupted,
etc.

When substitutes are enabled and a substitute for a derivation is
available, but the substitution attempt fails, Guix will attempt to
build the derivation locally depending on whether or not
@code{--fallback} was given (@pxref{fallback-option,, common build
option @code{--fallback}}).  Specifically, if @code{--fallback} was
omitted, then no local build will be performed, and the derivation is
considered to have failed.  However, if @code{--fallback} was given,
then Guix will attempt to build the derivation locally, and the success
or failure of the derivation depends on the success or failure of the
local build.  Note that when substitutes are disabled or no substitute
is available for the derivation in question, a local build will
@emph{always} be performed, regardless of whether or not
@code{--fallback} was given.

To get an idea of how many substitutes are available right now, you can
try running the @command{guix weather} command (@pxref{Invoking guix
weather}).  This command provides statistics on the substitutes provided
by a server.

@node On Trusting Binaries
@subsection On Trusting Binaries

@cindex trust, of pre-built binaries
Today, each individual's control over their own computing is at the
mercy of institutions, corporations, and groups with enough power and
determination to subvert the computing infrastructure and exploit its
weaknesses.  While using @code{@value{SUBSTITUTE-SERVER}} substitutes can be
convenient, we encourage users to also build on their own, or even run
their own build farm, such that @code{@value{SUBSTITUTE-SERVER}} is less of an
interesting target.  One way to help is by publishing the software you
build using @command{guix publish} so that others have one more choice
of server to download substitutes from (@pxref{Invoking guix publish}).

Guix has the foundations to maximize build reproducibility
(@pxref{Features}).  In most cases, independent builds of a given
package or derivation should yield bit-identical results.  Thus, through
a diverse set of independent package builds, we can strengthen the
integrity of our systems.  The @command{guix challenge} command aims to
help users assess substitute servers, and to assist developers in
finding out about non-deterministic package builds (@pxref{Invoking guix
challenge}).  Similarly, the @option{--check} option of @command{guix
build} allows users to check whether previously-installed substitutes
are genuine by rebuilding them locally (@pxref{build-check,
@command{guix build --check}}).

In the future, we want Guix to have support to publish and retrieve
binaries to/from other users, in a peer-to-peer fashion.  If you would
like to discuss this project, join us on @email{guix-devel@@gnu.org}.

@node Packages with Multiple Outputs
@section Packages with Multiple Outputs

@cindex multiple-output packages
@cindex package outputs
@cindex outputs

Often, packages defined in Guix have a single @dfn{output}---i.e., the
source package leads to exactly one directory in the store.  When running
@command{guix package -i glibc}, one installs the default output of the
GNU libc package; the default output is called @code{out}, but its name
can be omitted as shown in this command.  In this particular case, the
default output of @code{glibc} contains all the C header files, shared
libraries, static libraries, Info documentation, and other supporting
files.

Sometimes it is more appropriate to separate the various types of files
produced from a single source package into separate outputs.  For
instance, the GLib C library (used by GTK+ and related packages)
installs more than 20 MiB of reference documentation as HTML pages.
To save space for users who do not need it, the documentation goes to a
separate output, called @code{doc}.  To install the main GLib output,
which contains everything but the documentation, one would run:

@example
guix package -i glib
@end example

@cindex documentation
The command to install its documentation is:

@example
guix package -i glib:doc
@end example

Some packages install programs with different ``dependency footprints''.
For instance, the WordNet package installs both command-line tools and
graphical user interfaces (GUIs).  The former depend solely on the C
library, whereas the latter depend on Tcl/Tk and the underlying X
libraries.  In this case, we leave the command-line tools in the default
output, whereas the GUIs are in a separate output.  This allows users
who do not need the GUIs to save space.  The @command{guix size} command
can help find out about such situations (@pxref{Invoking guix size}).
@command{guix graph} can also be helpful (@pxref{Invoking guix graph}).

There are several such multiple-output packages in the GNU distribution.
Other conventional output names include @code{lib} for libraries and
possibly header files, @code{bin} for stand-alone programs, and
@code{debug} for debugging information (@pxref{Installing Debugging
Files}).  The outputs of a packages are listed in the third column of
the output of @command{guix package --list-available} (@pxref{Invoking
guix package}).


@node Invoking guix gc
@section Invoking @command{guix gc}

@cindex garbage collector
@cindex disk space
Packages that are installed, but not used, may be @dfn{garbage-collected}.
The @command{guix gc} command allows users to explicitly run the garbage
collector to reclaim space from the @file{/gnu/store} directory.  It is
the @emph{only} way to remove files from @file{/gnu/store}---removing
files or directories manually may break it beyond repair!

@cindex GC roots
@cindex garbage collector roots
The garbage collector has a set of known @dfn{roots}: any file under
@file{/gnu/store} reachable from a root is considered @dfn{live} and
cannot be deleted; any other file is considered @dfn{dead} and may be
deleted.  The set of garbage collector roots (``GC roots'' for short)
includes default user profiles; by default, the symlinks under
@file{/var/guix/gcroots} represent these GC roots.  New GC roots can be
added with @command{guix build --root}, for example (@pxref{Invoking
guix build}).  The @command{guix gc --list-roots} command lists them.

Prior to running @code{guix gc --collect-garbage} to make space, it is
often useful to remove old generations from user profiles; that way, old
package builds referenced by those generations can be reclaimed.  This
is achieved by running @code{guix package --delete-generations}
(@pxref{Invoking guix package}).

Our recommendation is to run a garbage collection periodically, or when
you are short on disk space.  For instance, to guarantee that at least
5@tie{}GB are available on your disk, simply run:

@example
guix gc -F 5G
@end example

It is perfectly safe to run as a non-interactive periodic job
(@pxref{Scheduled Job Execution}, for how to set up such a job).
Running @command{guix gc} with no arguments will collect as
much garbage as it can, but that is often inconvenient: you may find
yourself having to rebuild or re-download software that is ``dead'' from
the GC viewpoint but that is necessary to build other pieces of
software---e.g., the compiler tool chain.

The @command{guix gc} command has three modes of operation: it can be
used to garbage-collect any dead files (the default), to delete specific
files (the @code{--delete} option), to print garbage-collector
information, or for more advanced queries.  The garbage collection
options are as follows:

@table @code
@item --collect-garbage[=@var{min}]
@itemx -C [@var{min}]
Collect garbage---i.e., unreachable @file{/gnu/store} files and
sub-directories.  This is the default operation when no option is
specified.

When @var{min} is given, stop once @var{min} bytes have been collected.
@var{min} may be a number of bytes, or it may include a unit as a
suffix, such as @code{MiB} for mebibytes and @code{GB} for gigabytes
(@pxref{Block size, size specifications,, coreutils, GNU Coreutils}).

When @var{min} is omitted, collect all the garbage.

@item --free-space=@var{free}
@itemx -F @var{free}
Collect garbage until @var{free} space is available under
@file{/gnu/store}, if possible; @var{free} denotes storage space, such
as @code{500MiB}, as described above.

When @var{free} or more is already available in @file{/gnu/store}, do
nothing and exit immediately.

@item --delete-generations[=@var{duration}]
@itemx -d [@var{duration}]
Before starting the garbage collection process, delete all the generations
older than @var{duration}, for all the user profiles; when run as root, this
applies to all the profiles @emph{of all the users}.

For example, this command deletes all the generations of all your profiles
that are older than 2 months (except generations that are current), and then
proceeds to free space until at least 10 GiB are available:

@example
guix gc -d 2m -F 10G
@end example

@item --delete
@itemx -D
Attempt to delete all the store files and directories specified as
arguments.  This fails if some of the files are not in the store, or if
they are still live.

@item --list-failures
List store items corresponding to cached build failures.

This prints nothing unless the daemon was started with
@option{--cache-failures} (@pxref{Invoking guix-daemon,
@option{--cache-failures}}).

@item --list-roots
List the GC roots owned by the user; when run as root, list @emph{all} the GC
roots.

@item --clear-failures
Remove the specified store items from the failed-build cache.

Again, this option only makes sense when the daemon is started with
@option{--cache-failures}.  Otherwise, it does nothing.

@item --list-dead
Show the list of dead files and directories still present in the
store---i.e., files and directories no longer reachable from any root.

@item --list-live
Show the list of live store files and directories.

@end table

In addition, the references among existing store files can be queried:

@table @code

@item --references
@itemx --referrers
@cindex package dependencies
List the references (respectively, the referrers) of store files given
as arguments.

@item --requisites
@itemx -R
@cindex closure
List the requisites of the store files passed as arguments.  Requisites
include the store files themselves, their references, and the references
of these, recursively.  In other words, the returned list is the
@dfn{transitive closure} of the store files.

@xref{Invoking guix size}, for a tool to profile the size of the closure
of an element.  @xref{Invoking guix graph}, for a tool to visualize
the graph of references.

@item --derivers
@cindex derivation
Return the derivation(s) leading to the given store items
(@pxref{Derivations}).

For example, this command:

@example
guix gc --derivers `guix package -I ^emacs$ | cut -f4`
@end example

@noindent
returns the @file{.drv} file(s) leading to the @code{emacs} package
installed in your profile.

Note that there may be zero matching @file{.drv} files, for instance
because these files have been garbage-collected.  There can also be more
than one matching @file{.drv} due to fixed-output derivations.
@end table

Lastly, the following options allow you to check the integrity of the
store and to control disk usage.

@table @option

@item --verify[=@var{options}]
@cindex integrity, of the store
@cindex integrity checking
Verify the integrity of the store.

By default, make sure that all the store items marked as valid in the
database of the daemon actually exist in @file{/gnu/store}.

When provided, @var{options} must be a comma-separated list containing one
or more of @code{contents} and @code{repair}.

When passing @option{--verify=contents}, the daemon computes the
content hash of each store item and compares it against its hash in the
database.  Hash mismatches are reported as data corruptions.  Because it
traverses @emph{all the files in the store}, this command can take a
long time, especially on systems with a slow disk drive.

@cindex repairing the store
@cindex corruption, recovering from
Using @option{--verify=repair} or @option{--verify=contents,repair}
causes the daemon to try to repair corrupt store items by fetching
substitutes for them (@pxref{Substitutes}).  Because repairing is not
atomic, and thus potentially dangerous, it is available only to the
system administrator.  A lightweight alternative, when you know exactly
which items in the store are corrupt, is @command{guix build --repair}
(@pxref{Invoking guix build}).

@item --optimize
@cindex deduplication
Optimize the store by hard-linking identical files---this is
@dfn{deduplication}.

The daemon performs deduplication after each successful build or archive
import, unless it was started with @code{--disable-deduplication}
(@pxref{Invoking guix-daemon, @code{--disable-deduplication}}).  Thus,
this option is primarily useful when the daemon was running with
@code{--disable-deduplication}.

@cindex pull
Packages are installed or upgraded to the latest version available in
the distribution currently available on your local machine.  To update
that distribution, along with the Guix tools, you must run @command{guix
pull}: the command downloads the latest Guix source code and package
descriptions, and deploys it.  Source code is downloaded from a
@uref{https://git-scm.com, Git} repository, by default the official
GNU@tie{}Guix repository, though this can be customized.

On completion, @command{guix package} will use packages and package
versions from this just-retrieved copy of Guix.  Not only that, but all
the Guix commands and Scheme modules will also be taken from that latest
version.  New @command{guix} sub-commands added by the update also
become available.

Any user can update their Guix copy using @command{guix pull}, and the
effect is limited to the user who run @command{guix pull}.  For
instance, when user @code{root} runs @command{guix pull}, this has no
effect on the version of Guix that user @code{alice} sees, and vice
versa.

The result of running @command{guix pull} is a @dfn{profile} available
under @file{~/.config/guix/current} containing the latest Guix.  Thus,
make sure to add it to the beginning of your search path so that you use
the latest version, and similarly for the Info manual

@cindex configuration of @command{guix pull}
Guix and its package collection are updated by running @command{guix pull}
(@pxref{Invoking guix pull}).  By default @command{guix pull} downloads and
deploys Guix itself from the official GNU@tie{}Guix repository.  This can be
customized by defining @dfn{channels} in the
@file{~/.config/guix/channels.scm} file.  A channel specifies a URL and branch
of a Git repository to be deployed, and @command{guix pull} can be instructed
to pull from one or more channels.  In other words, channels can be used to
@emph{customize} and to @emph{extend} Guix, as we will see below.

@subsection Using a Custom Guix Channel

The channel called @code{guix} specifies where Guix itself---its command-line
tools as well as its package collection---should be downloaded.  For instance,
suppose you want to update from your own copy of the Guix repository at
@code{example.org}, and specifically the @code{super-hacks} branch, you can
write in @code{~/.config/guix/channels.scm} this specification:

@lisp
;; Tell 'guix pull' to use my own repo.
(list (channel
        (name 'guix)
        (url "https://example.org/my-guix.git")
        (branch "super-hacks")))
@end lisp

@noindent
From there on, @command{guix pull} will fetch code from the @code{super-hacks}
branch of the repository at @code{example.org}.

@subsection Specifying Additional Channels

@cindex extending the package collection (channels)
@cindex personal packages (channels)
@cindex channels, for personal packages
You can also specify @emph{additional channels} to pull from.  Let's say you
have a bunch of custom package variants or personal packages that you think
would make little sense to contribute to the Guix project, but would like to
have these packages transparently available to you at the command line.  You
would first write modules containing those package definitions (@pxref{Package
Modules}), maintain them in a Git repository, and then you and anyone else can
use it as an additional channel to get packages from.  Neat, no?

@c What follows stems from discussions at
@c <https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=22629#134> as well as
@c earlier discussions on guix-devel@gnu.org.
@quotation Warning
Before you, dear user, shout---``woow this is @emph{soooo coool}!''---and
publish your personal channel to the world, we would like to share a few words
of caution:

@itemize
@item
Before publishing a channel, please consider contributing your package
definitions to Guix proper (@pxref{Contributing}).  Guix as a project is open
to free software of all sorts, and packages in Guix proper are readily
available to all Guix users and benefit from the project's quality assurance
process.

@item
When you maintain package definitions outside Guix, we, Guix developers,
consider that @emph{the compatibility burden is on you}.  Remember that
package modules and package definitions are just Scheme code that uses various
programming interfaces (APIs).  We want to remain free to change these APIs to
keep improving Guix, possibly in ways that break your channel.  We never
change APIs gratuitously, but we will @emph{not} commit to freezing APIs
either.

@item
Corollary: if you're using an external channel and that channel breaks, please
@emph{report the issue to the channel authors}, not to the Guix project.
@end itemize

You've been warned!  Having said this, we believe external channels are a
practical way to exert your freedom to augment Guix' package collection and to
share your improvements, which are basic tenets of
@uref{https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html, free software}.  Please
email us at @email{guix-devel@@gnu.org} if you'd like to discuss this.
@end quotation

To use a channel, write @code{~/.config/guix/channels.scm} to instruct
@command{guix pull} to pull from it @emph{in addition} to the default Guix
channel(s):

@vindex %default-channels
@lisp
;; Add my personal packages to those Guix provides.
(cons (channel
        (name 'my-personal-packages)
        (url "https://example.org/personal-packages.git"))
      %default-channels)
@end lisp

@noindent
Note that the snippet above is (as always!)@: Scheme code; we use @code{cons} to
add a channel the list of channels that the variable @code{%default-channels}
is bound to (@pxref{Pairs, @code{cons} and lists,, guile, GNU Guile Reference
Manual}).  With this file in place, @command{guix pull} builds not only Guix
but also the package modules from your own repository.  The result in
@file{~/.config/guix/current} is the union of Guix with your own package
modules:

@example
$ guix pull --list-generations
@dots{}
Generation 19	Aug 27 2018 16:20:48
  guix d894ab8
    repository URL: https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/guix.git
    branch: master
    commit: d894ab8e9bfabcefa6c49d9ba2e834dd5a73a300
  my-personal-packages dd3df5e
    repository URL: https://example.org/personal-packages.git
    branch: master
    commit: dd3df5e2c8818760a8fc0bd699e55d3b69fef2bb
  11 new packages: my-gimp, my-emacs-with-cool-features, @dots{}
  4 packages upgraded: emacs-racket-mode@@0.0.2-2.1b78827, @dots{}
@end example

@noindent
The output of @command{guix pull} above shows that Generation@tie{}19 includes
both Guix and packages from the @code{my-personal-packages} channel.  Among
the new and upgraded packages that are listed, some like @code{my-gimp} and
@code{my-emacs-with-cool-features} might come from
@code{my-personal-packages}, while others come from the Guix default channel.

To create a channel, create a Git repository containing your own package
modules and make it available.  The repository can contain anything, but a
useful channel will contain Guile modules that export packages.  Once you
start using a channel, Guix will behave as if the root directory of that
channel's Git repository has been added to the Guile load path (@pxref{Load
Paths,,, guile, GNU Guile Reference Manual}).  For example, if your channel
contains a file at @file{my-packages/my-tools.scm} that defines a Guile
module, then the module will be available under the name @code{(my-packages
my-tools)}, and you will be able to use it like any other module
(@pxref{Modules,,, guile, GNU Guile Reference Manual}).

@cindex dependencies, channels
@cindex meta-data, channels
@subsection Declaring Channel Dependencies

Channel authors may decide to augment a package collection provided by other
channels.  They can declare their channel to be dependent on other channels in
a meta-data file @file{.guix-channel}, which is to be placed in the root of
the channel repository.

The meta-data file should contain a simple S-expression like this:

@lisp
(channel
 (version 0)
 (dependencies
  (channel
   (name some-collection)
   (url "https://example.org/first-collection.git"))
  (channel
   (name some-other-collection)
   (url "https://example.org/second-collection.git")
   (branch "testing"))))
@end lisp

In the above example this channel is declared to depend on two other channels,
which will both be fetched automatically.  The modules provided by the channel
will be compiled in an environment where the modules of all these declared
channels are available.

For the sake of reliability and maintainability, you should avoid dependencies
on channels that you don't control, and you should aim to keep the number of
dependencies to a minimum.

@subsection Replicating Guix

@cindex pinning, channels
@cindex replicating Guix
@cindex reproducibility, of Guix
The @command{guix pull --list-generations} output above shows precisely which
commits were used to build this instance of Guix.  We can thus replicate it,
say, on another machine, by providing a channel specification in
@file{~/.config/guix/channels.scm} that is ``pinned'' to these commits:

@lisp
;; Deploy specific commits of my channels of interest.
(list (channel
       (name 'guix)
       (url "https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/guix.git")
       (commit "d894ab8e9bfabcefa6c49d9ba2e834dd5a73a300"))
      (channel
       (name 'my-personal-packages)
       (url "https://example.org/personal-packages.git")
       (branch "dd3df5e2c8818760a8fc0bd699e55d3b69fef2bb")))
@end lisp

The @command{guix describe --format=channels} command can even generate this
list of channels directly (@pxref{Invoking guix describe}).

At this point the two machines run the @emph{exact same Guix}, with access to
the @emph{exact same packages}.  The output of @command{guix build gimp} on
one machine will be exactly the same, bit for bit, as the output of the same
command on the other machine.  It also means both machines have access to all
the source code of Guix and, transitively, to all the source code of every
package it defines.

This gives you super powers, allowing you to track the provenance of binary
artifacts with very fine grain, and to reproduce software environments at
will---some sort of ``meta reproducibility'' capabilities, if you will.
@xref{Inferiors}, for another way to take advantage of these super powers.

@node Inferiors
@section Inferiors

@c TODO: Remove this once we're more confident about API stability.
@quotation Note
The functionality described here is a ``technology preview'' as of version
@value{VERSION}.  As such, the interface is subject to change.
@end quotation

@cindex inferiors
@cindex composition of Guix revisions
Sometimes you might need to mix packages from the revision of Guix you're
currently running with packages available in a different revision of Guix.
Guix @dfn{inferiors} allow you to achieve that by composing different Guix
revisions in arbitrary ways.

@cindex inferior packages
Technically, an ``inferior'' is essentially a separate Guix process connected
to your main Guix process through a REPL (@pxref{Invoking guix repl}).  The
@code{(guix inferior)} module allows you to create inferiors and to
communicate with them.  It also provides a high-level interface to browse and
manipulate the packages that an inferior provides---@dfn{inferior packages}.

When combined with channels (@pxref{Channels}), inferiors provide a simple way
to interact with a separate revision of Guix.  For example, let's assume you
want to install in your profile the current @code{guile} package, along with
the @code{guile-json} as it existed in an older revision of Guix---perhaps
because the newer @code{guile-json} has an incompatible API and you want to
run your code against the old API@.  To do that, you could write a manifest for
use by @code{guix package --manifest} (@pxref{Invoking guix package}); in that
manifest, you would create an inferior for that old Guix revision you care
about, and you would look up the @code{guile-json} package in the inferior:

@lisp
(use-modules (guix inferior) (guix channels)
             (srfi srfi-1))   ;for 'first'

(define channels
  ;; This is the old revision from which we want to
  ;; extract guile-json.
  (list (channel
         (name 'guix)
         (url "https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/guix.git")
         (commit
          "65956ad3526ba09e1f7a40722c96c6ef7c0936fe"))))

(define inferior
  ;; An inferior representing the above revision.
  (inferior-for-channels channels))

;; Now create a manifest with the current "guile" package
;; and the old "guile-json" package.
(packages->manifest
 (list (first (lookup-inferior-packages inferior "guile-json"))
       (specification->package "guile")))
@end lisp

On its first run, @command{guix package --manifest} might have to build the
channel you specified before it can create the inferior; subsequent runs will
be much faster because the Guix revision will be cached.

The @code{(guix inferior)} module provides the following procedures to open an
inferior:

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} inferior-for-channels @var{channels} @
   [#:cache-directory] [#:ttl]
Return an inferior for @var{channels}, a list of channels.  Use the cache at
@var{cache-directory}, where entries can be reclaimed after @var{ttl} seconds.
This procedure opens a new connection to the build daemon.

As a side effect, this procedure may build or substitute binaries for
@var{channels}, which can take time.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} open-inferior @var{directory} @
  [#:command "bin/guix"]
Open the inferior Guix in @var{directory}, running
@code{@var{directory}/@var{command} repl} or equivalent.  Return @code{#f} if
the inferior could not be launched.
@end deffn

@cindex inferior packages
The procedures listed below allow you to obtain and manipulate inferior
packages.

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} inferior-packages @var{inferior}
Return the list of packages known to @var{inferior}.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} lookup-inferior-packages @var{inferior} @var{name} @
   [@var{version}]
Return the sorted list of inferior packages matching @var{name} in
@var{inferior}, with highest version numbers first.  If @var{version} is true,
return only packages with a version number prefixed by @var{version}.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} inferior-package? @var{obj}
Return true if @var{obj} is an inferior package.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} inferior-package-name @var{package}
@deffnx {Scheme Procedure} inferior-package-version @var{package}
@deffnx {Scheme Procedure} inferior-package-synopsis @var{package}
@deffnx {Scheme Procedure} inferior-package-description @var{package}
@deffnx {Scheme Procedure} inferior-package-home-page @var{package}
@deffnx {Scheme Procedure} inferior-package-location @var{package}
@deffnx {Scheme Procedure} inferior-package-inputs @var{package}
@deffnx {Scheme Procedure} inferior-package-native-inputs @var{package}
@deffnx {Scheme Procedure} inferior-package-propagated-inputs @var{package}
@deffnx {Scheme Procedure} inferior-package-transitive-propagated-inputs @var{package}
@deffnx {Scheme Procedure} inferior-package-native-search-paths @var{package}
@deffnx {Scheme Procedure} inferior-package-transitive-native-search-paths @var{package}
@deffnx {Scheme Procedure} inferior-package-search-paths @var{package}
These procedures are the counterpart of package record accessors
(@pxref{package Reference}).  Most of them work by querying the inferior
@var{package} comes from, so the inferior must still be live when you call
these procedures.
@end deffn

Inferior packages can be used transparently like any other package or
file-like object in G-expressions (@pxref{G-Expressions}).  They are also
transparently handled by the @code{packages->manifest} procedure, which is
commonly use in manifests (@pxref{Invoking guix package, the
@option{--manifest} option of @command{guix package}}).  Thus you can insert
an inferior package pretty much anywhere you would insert a regular package:
in manifests, in the @code{packages} field of your @code{operating-system}
declaration, and so on.

@cindex reproducibility
@cindex replicating Guix
Often you may want to answer questions like: ``Which revision of Guix am I
using?'' or ``Which channels am I using?''  This is useful information in many
situations: if you want to @emph{replicate} an environment on a different
machine or user account, if you want to report a bug or to determine what
change in the channels you are using caused it, or if you want to record your
system state for reproducibility purposes.  The @command{guix describe}
command answers these questions.

When run from a @command{guix pull}ed @command{guix}, @command{guix describe}
displays the channel(s) that it was built from, including their repository URL
and commit IDs (@pxref{Channels}):

@example
$ guix describe
Generation 10	Sep 03 2018 17:32:44	(current)
  guix e0fa68c
    repository URL: https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/guix.git
    branch: master
    commit: e0fa68c7718fffd33d81af415279d6ddb518f727
@end example

If you're familiar with the Git version control system, this is similar in
spirit to @command{git describe}; the output is also similar to that of
@command{guix pull --list-generations}, but limited to the current generation
(@pxref{Invoking guix pull, the @option{--list-generations} option}).  Because
the Git commit ID shown above unambiguously refers to a snapshot of Guix, this
information is all it takes to describe the revision of Guix you're using, and
also to replicate it.

To make it easier to replicate Guix, @command{guix describe} can also be asked
to return a list of channels instead of the human-readable description above:

@example
$ guix describe -f channels
(list (channel
        (name 'guix)
        (url "https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/guix.git")
        (commit
          "e0fa68c7718fffd33d81af415279d6ddb518f727")))
@end example

@noindent
You can save this to a file and feed it to @command{guix pull -C} on some
other machine or at a later point in time, which will instantiate @emph{this
exact Guix revision} (@pxref{Invoking guix pull, the @option{-C} option}).
From there on, since you're able to deploy the same revision of Guix, you can
just as well @emph{replicate a complete software environment}.  We humbly
think that this is @emph{awesome}, and we hope you'll like it too!

The details of the options supported by @command{guix describe} are as
follows:

@table @code
@item --format=@var{format}
@itemx -f @var{format}
Produce output in the specified @var{format}, one of:

@table @code
@item human
produce human-readable output;
@item channels
produce a list of channel specifications that can be passed to @command{guix
pull -C} or installed as @file{~/.config/guix/channels.scm} (@pxref{Invoking
guix pull});
@item json
@cindex JSON
produce a list of channel specifications in JSON format;
@item recutils
produce a list of channel specifications in Recutils format.

@item --profile=@var{profile}
@itemx -p @var{profile}

@cindex archive
The @command{guix archive} command allows users to @dfn{export} files
from the store into a single archive, and to later @dfn{import} them on
a machine that runs Guix.
In particular, it allows store files to be transferred from one machine
to the store on another machine.

@quotation Note
If you're looking for a way to produce archives in a format suitable for
tools other than Guix, @pxref{Invoking guix pack}.
@end quotation

@cindex exporting store items
To export store files as an archive to standard output, run:

@example
guix archive --export @var{options} @var{specifications}...
@end example

@var{specifications} may be either store file names or package
specifications, as for @command{guix package} (@pxref{Invoking guix
package}).  For instance, the following command creates an archive
containing the @code{gui} output of the @code{git} package and the main
output of @code{emacs}:

@example
guix archive --export git:gui /gnu/store/...-emacs-24.3 > great.nar
@end example

If the specified packages are not built yet, @command{guix archive}
automatically builds them.  The build process may be controlled with the
common build options (@pxref{Common Build Options}).

To transfer the @code{emacs} package to a machine connected over SSH,
one would run:

@example
guix archive --export -r emacs | ssh the-machine guix archive --import
@end example

@noindent
Similarly, a complete user profile may be transferred from one machine
to another like this:

@example
guix archive --export -r $(readlink -f ~/.guix-profile) | \
  ssh the-machine guix-archive --import
@end example

@noindent
However, note that, in both examples, all of @code{emacs} and the
profile as well as all of their dependencies are transferred (due to
@code{-r}), regardless of what is already available in the store on the
target machine.  The @code{--missing} option can help figure out which
items are missing from the target store.  The @command{guix copy}
command simplifies and optimizes this whole process, so this is probably
what you should use in this case (@pxref{Invoking guix copy}).

@cindex nar, archive format
@cindex normalized archive (nar)
Archives are stored in the ``normalized archive'' or ``nar'' format, which is
comparable in spirit to `tar', but with differences
that make it more appropriate for our purposes.  First, rather than
recording all Unix metadata for each file, the nar format only mentions
the file type (regular, directory, or symbolic link); Unix permissions
and owner/group are dismissed.  Second, the order in which directory
entries are stored always follows the order of file names according to
the C locale collation order.  This makes archive production fully
deterministic.

When exporting, the daemon digitally signs the contents of the archive,
and that digital signature is appended.  When importing, the daemon
verifies the signature and rejects the import in case of an invalid
signature or if the signing key is not authorized.
@c FIXME: Add xref to daemon doc about signatures.

The main options are:

@table @code
@item --export
Export the specified store files or packages (see below.)  Write the
resulting archive to the standard output.

Dependencies are @emph{not} included in the output, unless
@code{--recursive} is passed.

@item -r
@itemx --recursive
When combined with @code{--export}, this instructs @command{guix
archive} to include dependencies of the given items in the archive.
Thus, the resulting archive is self-contained: it contains the closure
of the exported store items.

@item --import
Read an archive from the standard input, and import the files listed
therein into the store.  Abort if the archive has an invalid digital
signature, or if it is signed by a public key not among the authorized
keys (see @code{--authorize} below.)

@item --missing
Read a list of store file names from the standard input, one per line,
and write on the standard output the subset of these files missing from
the store.

@item --generate-key[=@var{parameters}]
@cindex signing, archives
Generate a new key pair for the daemon.  This is a prerequisite before
archives can be exported with @code{--export}.  Note that this operation
usually takes time, because it needs to gather enough entropy to
generate the key pair.

The generated key pair is typically stored under @file{/etc/guix}, in
@file{signing-key.pub} (public key) and @file{signing-key.sec} (private
key, which must be kept secret.)  When @var{parameters} is omitted,
an ECDSA key using the Ed25519 curve is generated, or, for Libgcrypt
versions before 1.6.0, it is a 4096-bit RSA key.
Alternatively, @var{parameters} can specify
@code{genkey} parameters suitable for Libgcrypt (@pxref{General
public-key related Functions, @code{gcry_pk_genkey},, gcrypt, The
Libgcrypt Reference Manual}).

@item --authorize
@cindex authorizing, archives
Authorize imports signed by the public key passed on standard input.
The public key must be in ``s-expression advanced format''---i.e., the
same format as the @file{signing-key.pub} file.

The list of authorized keys is kept in the human-editable file
@file{/etc/guix/acl}.  The file contains
@url{http://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/Sexp.txt, ``advanced-format
s-expressions''} and is structured as an access-control list in the
@url{http://theworld.com/~cme/spki.txt, Simple Public-Key Infrastructure
(SPKI)}.

@item --extract=@var{directory}
@itemx -x @var{directory}
Read a single-item archive as served by substitute servers
(@pxref{Substitutes}) and extract it to @var{directory}.  This is a
low-level operation needed in only very narrow use cases; see below.

For example, the following command extracts the substitute for Emacs
served by @code{@value{SUBSTITUTE-SERVER}} to @file{/tmp/emacs}:

@example
$ wget -O - \
  https://@value{SUBSTITUTE-SERVER}/nar/@dots{}-emacs-24.5 \
  | bunzip2 | guix archive -x /tmp/emacs
@end example

Single-item archives are different from multiple-item archives produced
by @command{guix archive --export}; they contain a single store item,
and they do @emph{not} embed a signature.  Thus this operation does
@emph{no} signature verification and its output should be considered
unsafe.

The primary purpose of this operation is to facilitate inspection of
archive contents coming from possibly untrusted substitute servers.

@cindex software development
If you are a software developer, Guix provides tools that you should find
helpful---independently of the language you're developing in.  This is what
this chapter is about.

The @command{guix environment} command provides a convenient way to set up
@dfn{development environments} containing all the dependencies and tools
necessary to work on the software package of your choice.  The @command{guix
pack} command allows you to create @dfn{application bundles} that can be
easily distributed to users who do not run Guix.

@node Invoking guix environment
@section Invoking @command{guix environment}

@cindex reproducible build environments
@cindex development environments
@cindex @command{guix environment}
@cindex environment, package build environment
The purpose of @command{guix environment} is to assist hackers in
creating reproducible development environments without polluting their
package profile.  The @command{guix environment} tool takes one or more
packages, builds all of their inputs, and creates a shell
environment to use them.

The general syntax is:

@example
guix environment @var{options} @var{package}@dots{}
@end example

The following example spawns a new shell set up for the development of
GNU@tie{}Guile:

@example
guix environment guile
@end example

If the needed dependencies are not built yet, @command{guix environment}
automatically builds them.  The environment of the new shell is an augmented
version of the environment that @command{guix environment} was run in.
It contains the necessary search paths for building the given package
added to the existing environment variables.  To create a ``pure''
environment, in which the original environment variables have been unset,
use the @code{--pure} option@footnote{Users sometimes wrongfully augment
environment variables such as @code{PATH} in their @file{~/.bashrc}
file.  As a consequence, when @code{guix environment} launches it, Bash
may read @file{~/.bashrc}, thereby introducing ``impurities'' in these
environment variables.  It is an error to define such environment
variables in @file{.bashrc}; instead, they should be defined in
@file{.bash_profile}, which is sourced only by log-in shells.
@xref{Bash Startup Files,,, bash, The GNU Bash Reference Manual}, for
details on Bash start-up files.}.

@vindex GUIX_ENVIRONMENT
@command{guix environment} defines the @code{GUIX_ENVIRONMENT}
variable in the shell it spawns; its value is the file name of the
profile of this environment.  This allows users to, say, define a
specific prompt for development environments in their @file{.bashrc}
(@pxref{Bash Startup Files,,, bash, The GNU Bash Reference Manual}):

@example
if [ -n "$GUIX_ENVIRONMENT" ]
then
    export PS1="\u@@\h \w [dev]\$ "
fi
@end example

@noindent
...@: or to browse the profile:

@example
$ ls "$GUIX_ENVIRONMENT/bin"
@end example

Additionally, more than one package may be specified, in which case the
union of the inputs for the given packages are used.  For example, the
command below spawns a shell where all of the dependencies of both Guile
and Emacs are available:

@example
guix environment guile emacs
@end example

Sometimes an interactive shell session is not desired.  An arbitrary
command may be invoked by placing the @code{--} token to separate the
command from the rest of the arguments:

@example
guix environment guile -- make -j4
@end example

In other situations, it is more convenient to specify the list of
packages needed in the environment.  For example, the following command
runs @command{python} from an environment containing Python@tie{}2.7 and
NumPy:

@example
guix environment --ad-hoc python2-numpy python-2.7 -- python
@end example

Furthermore, one might want the dependencies of a package and also some
additional packages that are not build-time or runtime dependencies, but
are useful when developing nonetheless.  Because of this, the
@code{--ad-hoc} flag is positional.  Packages appearing before
@code{--ad-hoc} are interpreted as packages whose dependencies will be
added to the environment.  Packages appearing after are interpreted as
packages that will be added to the environment directly.  For example,
the following command creates a Guix development environment that
additionally includes Git and strace:

@example
guix environment guix --ad-hoc git strace
@end example

Sometimes it is desirable to isolate the environment as much as
possible, for maximal purity and reproducibility.  In particular, when
using Guix on a host distro that is not Guix System, it is desirable to
prevent access to @file{/usr/bin} and other system-wide resources from
the development environment.  For example, the following command spawns
a Guile REPL in a ``container'' where only the store and the current
working directory are mounted:

@example
guix environment --ad-hoc --container guile -- guile
@end example

@quotation Note
The @code{--container} option requires Linux-libre 3.19 or newer.
@end quotation

The available options are summarized below.

@table @code
@item --root=@var{file}
@itemx -r @var{file}
@cindex persistent environment
@cindex garbage collector root, for environments
Make @var{file} a symlink to the profile for this environment, and
register it as a garbage collector root.

This is useful if you want to protect your environment from garbage
collection, to make it ``persistent''.

When this option is omitted, the environment is protected from garbage
collection only for the duration of the @command{guix environment}
session.  This means that next time you recreate the same environment,
you could have to rebuild or re-download packages.  @xref{Invoking guix
gc}, for more on GC roots.

@item --expression=@var{expr}
@itemx -e @var{expr}
Create an environment for the package or list of packages that
@var{expr} evaluates to.

For example, running:

@example
guix environment -e '(@@ (gnu packages maths) petsc-openmpi)'
@end example

starts a shell with the environment for this specific variant of the
PETSc package.

Running:

@example
guix environment --ad-hoc -e '(@@ (gnu) %base-packages)'
@end example

starts a shell with all the base system packages available.

The above commands only use the default output of the given packages.
To select other outputs, two element tuples can be specified:

@example
guix environment --ad-hoc -e '(list (@@ (gnu packages bash) bash) "include")'
@end example

@item --load=@var{file}
@itemx -l @var{file}
Create an environment for the package or list of packages that the code
within @var{file} evaluates to.

As an example, @var{file} might contain a definition like this
(@pxref{Defining Packages}):

@example
@verbatiminclude environment-gdb.scm
@end example

@item --manifest=@var{file}
@itemx -m @var{file}
Create an environment for the packages contained in the manifest object
returned by the Scheme code in @var{file}.

This is similar to the same-named option in @command{guix package}
(@pxref{profile-manifest, @option{--manifest}}) and uses the same
manifest files.

@item --ad-hoc
Include all specified packages in the resulting environment, as if an
@i{ad hoc} package were defined with them as inputs.  This option is
useful for quickly creating an environment without having to write a
package expression to contain the desired inputs.

For instance, the command:

@example
guix environment --ad-hoc guile guile-sdl -- guile
@end example

runs @command{guile} in an environment where Guile and Guile-SDL are
available.

Note that this example implicitly asks for the default output of
@code{guile} and @code{guile-sdl}, but it is possible to ask for a
specific output---e.g., @code{glib:bin} asks for the @code{bin} output
of @code{glib} (@pxref{Packages with Multiple Outputs}).

This option may be composed with the default behavior of @command{guix
environment}.  Packages appearing before @code{--ad-hoc} are interpreted
as packages whose dependencies will be added to the environment, the
default behavior.  Packages appearing after are interpreted as packages
that will be added to the environment directly.

@item --pure
Unset existing environment variables when building the new environment, except
those specified with @option{--preserve} (see below.)  This has the effect of
creating an environment in which search paths only contain package inputs.

@item --preserve=@var{regexp}
@itemx -E @var{regexp}
When used alongside @option{--pure}, preserve the environment variables
matching @var{regexp}---in other words, put them on a ``white list'' of
environment variables that must be preserved.  This option can be repeated
several times.

@example
guix environment --pure --preserve=^SLURM --ad-hoc openmpi @dots{} \
  -- mpirun @dots{}
@end example

This example runs @command{mpirun} in a context where the only environment
variables defined are @code{PATH}, environment variables whose name starts
with @code{SLURM}, as well as the usual ``precious'' variables (@code{HOME},
@code{USER}, etc.)

@item --search-paths
Display the environment variable definitions that make up the
environment.

@item --system=@var{system}
@itemx -s @var{system}
Attempt to build for @var{system}---e.g., @code{i686-linux}.

@item --container
@itemx -C
@cindex container
Run @var{command} within an isolated container.  The current working
directory outside the container is mapped inside the container.
Additionally, unless overridden with @code{--user}, a dummy home
directory is created that matches the current user's home directory, and
@file{/etc/passwd} is configured accordingly.

The spawned process runs as the current user outside the container.  Inside
the container, it has the same UID and GID as the current user, unless
@option{--user} is passed (see below.)

@item --network
@itemx -N
For containers, share the network namespace with the host system.
Containers created without this flag only have access to the loopback
device.

@item --link-profile
@itemx -P
For containers, link the environment profile to
@file{~/.guix-profile} within the container.  This is equivalent to
running the command @command{ln -s $GUIX_ENVIRONMENT ~/.guix-profile}
within the container.  Linking will fail and abort the environment if
the directory already exists, which will certainly be the case if
@command{guix environment} was invoked in the user's home directory.

Certain packages are configured to look in
@code{~/.guix-profile} for configuration files and data;@footnote{For
example, the @code{fontconfig} package inspects
@file{~/.guix-profile/share/fonts} for additional fonts.}
@code{--link-profile} allows these programs to behave as expected within
the environment.

@item --user=@var{user}
@itemx -u @var{user}
For containers, use the username @var{user} in place of the current
user.  The generated @file{/etc/passwd} entry within the container will
contain the name @var{user}, the home directory will be
@file{/home/@var{user}}, and no user GECOS data will be copied.  Furthermore,
the UID and GID inside the container are 1000.  @var{user}
need not exist on the system.

Additionally, any shared or exposed path (see @code{--share} and
@code{--expose} respectively) whose target is within the current user's
home directory will be remapped relative to @file{/home/USER}; this
includes the automatic mapping of the current working directory.

@example
# will expose paths as /home/foo/wd, /home/foo/test, and /home/foo/target
cd $HOME/wd
guix environment --container --user=foo \
     --expose=$HOME/test \
     --expose=/tmp/target=$HOME/target
@end example

While this will limit the leaking of user identity through home paths
and each of the user fields, this is only one useful component of a
broader privacy/anonymity solution---not one in and of itself.

@item --expose=@var{source}[=@var{target}]
For containers, expose the file system @var{source} from the host system
as the read-only file system @var{target} within the container.  If
@var{target} is not specified, @var{source} is used as the target mount
point in the container.

The example below spawns a Guile REPL in a container in which the user's
home directory is accessible read-only via the @file{/exchange}
directory:

@example
guix environment --container --expose=$HOME=/exchange --ad-hoc guile -- guile
@end example

@item --share=@var{source}[=@var{target}]
For containers, share the file system @var{source} from the host system
as the writable file system @var{target} within the container.  If
@var{target} is not specified, @var{source} is used as the target mount
point in the container.

The example below spawns a Guile REPL in a container in which the user's
home directory is accessible for both reading and writing via the
@file{/exchange} directory:

@example
guix environment --container --share=$HOME=/exchange --ad-hoc guile -- guile
@end example
@end table

@command{guix environment}
also supports all of the common build options that @command{guix
build} supports (@pxref{Common Build Options}) as well as package
transformation options (@pxref{Package Transformation Options}).

@node Invoking guix pack
@section Invoking @command{guix pack}

Occasionally you want to pass software to people who are not (yet!)
lucky enough to be using Guix.  You'd tell them to run @command{guix
package -i @var{something}}, but that's not possible in this case.  This
is where @command{guix pack} comes in.

@quotation Note
If you are looking for ways to exchange binaries among machines that
already run Guix, @pxref{Invoking guix copy}, @ref{Invoking guix
publish}, and @ref{Invoking guix archive}.
@end quotation

@cindex pack
@cindex bundle
@cindex application bundle
@cindex software bundle
The @command{guix pack} command creates a shrink-wrapped @dfn{pack} or
@dfn{software bundle}: it creates a tarball or some other archive
containing the binaries of the software you're interested in, and all
its dependencies.  The resulting archive can be used on any machine that
does not have Guix, and people can run the exact same binaries as those
you have with Guix.  The pack itself is created in a bit-reproducible
fashion, so anyone can verify that it really contains the build results
that you pretend to be shipping.

For example, to create a bundle containing Guile, Emacs, Geiser, and all
their dependencies, you can run:

@example
$ guix pack guile emacs geiser
@dots{}
/gnu/store/@dots{}-pack.tar.gz
@end example

The result here is a tarball containing a @file{/gnu/store} directory
with all the relevant packages.  The resulting tarball contains a
@dfn{profile} with the three packages of interest; the profile is the
same as would be created by @command{guix package -i}.  It is this
mechanism that is used to create Guix's own standalone binary tarball
(@pxref{Binary Installation}).

Users of this pack would have to run
@file{/gnu/store/@dots{}-profile/bin/guile} to run Guile, which you may
find inconvenient.  To work around it, you can create, say, a
@file{/opt/gnu/bin} symlink to the profile:

@example
guix pack -S /opt/gnu/bin=bin guile emacs geiser
@end example

@noindent
That way, users can happily type @file{/opt/gnu/bin/guile} and enjoy.

@cindex relocatable binaries, with @command{guix pack}
What if the recipient of your pack does not have root privileges on
their machine, and thus cannot unpack it in the root file system?  In
that case, you will want to use the @code{--relocatable} option (see
below).  This option produces @dfn{relocatable binaries}, meaning they
they can be placed anywhere in the file system hierarchy: in the example
above, users can unpack your tarball in their home directory and
directly run @file{./opt/gnu/bin/guile}.

@cindex Docker, build an image with guix pack
Alternatively, you can produce a pack in the Docker image format using
the following command:

@example
guix pack -f docker guile emacs geiser
@end example

@noindent
The result is a tarball that can be passed to the @command{docker load}
command.  See the
@uref{https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/load/, Docker
documentation} for more information.

@cindex Singularity, build an image with guix pack
@cindex SquashFS, build an image with guix pack
Yet another option is to produce a SquashFS image with the following
command:

@example
guix pack -f squashfs guile emacs geiser
@end example

@noindent
The result is a SquashFS file system image that can either be mounted or
directly be used as a file system container image with the
@uref{http://singularity.lbl.gov, Singularity container execution
environment}, using commands like @command{singularity shell} or
@command{singularity exec}.

Several command-line options allow you to customize your pack:

@table @code
@item --format=@var{format}
@itemx -f @var{format}
Produce a pack in the given @var{format}.

The available formats are:

@table @code
@item tarball
This is the default format.  It produces a tarball containing all the
specified binaries and symlinks.

@item docker
This produces a tarball that follows the
@uref{https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/image/spec/v1.2.md,
Docker Image Specification}.

@item squashfs
This produces a SquashFS image containing all the specified binaries and
symlinks, as well as empty mount points for virtual file systems like
procfs.
@end table

@cindex relocatable binaries
@item --relocatable
@itemx -R
Produce @dfn{relocatable binaries}---i.e., binaries that can be placed
anywhere in the file system hierarchy and run from there.

When this option is passed once, the resulting binaries require support for
@dfn{user namespaces} in the kernel Linux; when passed
@emph{twice}@footnote{Here's a trick to memorize it: @code{-RR}, which adds
PRoot support, can be thought of as the abbreviation of ``Really
Relocatable''.  Neat, isn't it?}, relocatable binaries fall to back to PRoot
if user namespaces are unavailable, and essentially work anywhere---see below
for the implications.

For example, if you create a pack containing Bash with:

@example
guix pack -RR -S /mybin=bin bash
@end example

@noindent
...@: you can copy that pack to a machine that lacks Guix, and from your
home directory as a normal user, run:

@example
tar xf pack.tar.gz
./mybin/sh
@end example

@noindent
In that shell, if you type @code{ls /gnu/store}, you'll notice that
@file{/gnu/store} shows up and contains all the dependencies of
@code{bash}, even though the machine actually lacks @file{/gnu/store}
altogether!  That is probably the simplest way to deploy Guix-built
software on a non-Guix machine.

@quotation Note
By default, relocatable binaries rely on the @dfn{user namespace} feature of
the kernel Linux, which allows unprivileged users to mount or change root.
Old versions of Linux did not support it, and some GNU/Linux distributions
turn it off.

To produce relocatable binaries that work even in the absence of user
namespaces, pass @option{--relocatable} or @option{-R} @emph{twice}.  In that
case, binaries will try user namespace support and fall back to PRoot if user
namespaces are not supported.

The @uref{https://proot-me.github.io/, PRoot} program provides the necessary
support for file system virtualization.  It achieves that by using the
@code{ptrace} system call on the running program.  This approach has the
advantage to work without requiring special kernel support, but it incurs
run-time overhead every time a system call is made.
@end quotation

@item --expression=@var{expr}
@itemx -e @var{expr}
Consider the package @var{expr} evaluates to.

This has the same purpose as the same-named option in @command{guix
build} (@pxref{Additional Build Options, @code{--expression} in
@command{guix build}}).

@item --manifest=@var{file}
@itemx -m @var{file}
Use the packages contained in the manifest object returned by the Scheme
code in @var{file}.

This has a similar purpose as the same-named option in @command{guix
package} (@pxref{profile-manifest, @option{--manifest}}) and uses the
same manifest files.  It allows you to define a collection of packages
once and use it both for creating profiles and for creating archives
for use on machines that do not have Guix installed.  Note that you can
specify @emph{either} a manifest file @emph{or} a list of packages,
but not both.

@item --system=@var{system}
@itemx -s @var{system}
Attempt to build for @var{system}---e.g., @code{i686-linux}---instead of
the system type of the build host.

@item --target=@var{triplet}
@cindex cross-compilation
Cross-build for @var{triplet}, which must be a valid GNU triplet, such
as @code{"mips64el-linux-gnu"} (@pxref{Specifying target triplets, GNU
configuration triplets,, autoconf, Autoconf}).

@item --compression=@var{tool}
@itemx -C @var{tool}
Compress the resulting tarball using @var{tool}---one of @code{gzip},
@code{bzip2}, @code{xz}, @code{lzip}, or @code{none} for no compression.

@item --symlink=@var{spec}
@itemx -S @var{spec}
Add the symlinks specified by @var{spec} to the pack.  This option can
appear several times.

@var{spec} has the form @code{@var{source}=@var{target}}, where
@var{source} is the symlink that will be created and @var{target} is the
symlink target.

For instance, @code{-S /opt/gnu/bin=bin} creates a @file{/opt/gnu/bin}
symlink pointing to the @file{bin} sub-directory of the profile.

@item --save-provenance
Save provenance information for the packages passed on the command line.
Provenance information includes the URL and commit of the channels in use
(@pxref{Channels}).

Provenance information is saved in the
@file{/gnu/store/@dots{}-profile/manifest} file in the pack, along with the
usual package metadata---the name and version of each package, their
propagated inputs, and so on.  It is useful information to the recipient of
the pack, who then knows how the pack was (supposedly) obtained.

This option is not enabled by default because, like timestamps, provenance
information contributes nothing to the build process.  In other words, there
is an infinity of channel URLs and commit IDs that can lead to the same pack.
Recording such ``silent'' metadata in the output thus potentially breaks the
source-to-binary bitwise reproducibility property.

@item --localstatedir
@itemx --profile-name=@var{name}
Include the ``local state directory'', @file{/var/guix}, in the resulting
pack, and notably the @file{/var/guix/profiles/per-user/root/@var{name}}
profile---by default @var{name} is @code{guix-profile}, which corresponds to
@file{~root/.guix-profile}.

@file{/var/guix} contains the store database (@pxref{The Store}) as well
as garbage-collector roots (@pxref{Invoking guix gc}).  Providing it in
the pack means that the store is ``complete'' and manageable by Guix;
not providing it pack means that the store is ``dead'': items cannot be
added to it or removed from it after extraction of the pack.

One use case for this is the Guix self-contained binary tarball
(@pxref{Binary Installation}).

@item --bootstrap
Use the bootstrap binaries to build the pack.  This option is only
useful to Guix developers.
@end table

In addition, @command{guix pack} supports all the common build options
(@pxref{Common Build Options}) and all the package transformation
options (@pxref{Package Transformation Options}).


@c *********************************************************************
@node Programming Interface
@chapter Programming Interface

GNU Guix provides several Scheme programming interfaces (APIs) to
define, build, and query packages.  The first interface allows users to
write high-level package definitions.  These definitions refer to
familiar packaging concepts, such as the name and version of a package,
its build system, and its dependencies.  These definitions can then be
turned into concrete build actions.

Build actions are performed by the Guix daemon, on behalf of users.  In a
standard setup, the daemon has write access to the store---the
@file{/gnu/store} directory---whereas users do not.  The recommended
setup also has the daemon perform builds in chroots, under a specific
build users, to minimize interference with the rest of the system.

@cindex derivation
Lower-level APIs are available to interact with the daemon and the
store.  To instruct the daemon to perform a build action, users actually
provide it with a @dfn{derivation}.  A derivation is a low-level
representation of the build actions to be taken, and the environment in
which they should occur---derivations are to package definitions what
assembly is to C programs.  The term ``derivation'' comes from the fact
that build results @emph{derive} from them.

This chapter describes all these APIs in turn, starting from high-level
package definitions.

@node Package Modules
@section Package Modules

From a programming viewpoint, the package definitions of the
GNU distribution are provided by Guile modules in the @code{(gnu packages
@dots{})} name space@footnote{Note that packages under the @code{(gnu
packages @dots{})} module name space are not necessarily ``GNU
packages''.  This module naming scheme follows the usual Guile module
naming convention: @code{gnu} means that these modules are distributed
as part of the GNU system, and @code{packages} identifies modules that
define packages.}  (@pxref{Modules, Guile modules,, guile, GNU Guile
Reference Manual}).  For instance, the @code{(gnu packages emacs)}
module exports a variable named @code{emacs}, which is bound to a
@code{<package>} object (@pxref{Defining Packages}).

The @code{(gnu packages @dots{})} module name space is
automatically scanned for packages by the command-line tools.  For
instance, when running @code{guix package -i emacs}, all the @code{(gnu
packages @dots{})} modules are scanned until one that exports a package
object whose name is @code{emacs} is found.  This package search
facility is implemented in the @code{(gnu packages)} module.

@cindex customization, of packages
@cindex package module search path
Users can store package definitions in modules with different
names---e.g., @code{(my-packages emacs)}@footnote{Note that the file
name and module name must match.  For instance, the @code{(my-packages
emacs)} module must be stored in a @file{my-packages/emacs.scm} file
relative to the load path specified with @option{--load-path} or
@code{GUIX_PACKAGE_PATH}.  @xref{Modules and the File System,,,
guile, GNU Guile Reference Manual}, for details.}.  There are two ways to make
these package definitions visible to the user interfaces:

@enumerate
@item
By adding the directory containing your package modules to the search path
with the @code{-L} flag of @command{guix package} and other commands
(@pxref{Common Build Options}), or by setting the @code{GUIX_PACKAGE_PATH}
environment variable described below.

@item
By defining a @dfn{channel} and configuring @command{guix pull} so that it
pulls from it.  A channel is essentially a Git repository containing package
modules.  @xref{Channels}, for more information on how to define and use
channels.
@end enumerate

@code{GUIX_PACKAGE_PATH} works similarly to other search path variables:

@defvr {Environment Variable} GUIX_PACKAGE_PATH
This is a colon-separated list of directories to search for additional
package modules.  Directories listed in this variable take precedence
over the own modules of the distribution.
@end defvr

The distribution is fully @dfn{bootstrapped} and @dfn{self-contained}:
each package is built based solely on other packages in the
distribution.  The root of this dependency graph is a small set of
@dfn{bootstrap binaries}, provided by the @code{(gnu packages
bootstrap)} module.  For more information on bootstrapping,
@pxref{Bootstrapping}.

@node Defining Packages
@section Defining Packages

The high-level interface to package definitions is implemented in the
@code{(guix packages)} and @code{(guix build-system)} modules.  As an
example, the package definition, or @dfn{recipe}, for the GNU Hello
package looks like this:

@example
(define-module (gnu packages hello)
  #:use-module (guix packages)
  #:use-module (guix download)
  #:use-module (guix build-system gnu)
  #:use-module (guix licenses)
  #:use-module (gnu packages gawk))

(define-public hello
  (package
    (name "hello")
    (version "2.10")
    (source (origin
              (method url-fetch)
              (uri (string-append "mirror://gnu/hello/hello-" version
                                  ".tar.gz"))
              (sha256
               (base32
                "0ssi1wpaf7plaswqqjwigppsg5fyh99vdlb9kzl7c9lng89ndq1i"))))
    (build-system gnu-build-system)
    (arguments '(#:configure-flags '("--enable-silent-rules")))
    (inputs `(("gawk" ,gawk)))
    (synopsis "Hello, GNU world: An example GNU package")
    (description "Guess what GNU Hello prints!")
    (home-page "http://www.gnu.org/software/hello/")
    (license gpl3+)))
@end example

@noindent
Without being a Scheme expert, the reader may have guessed the meaning
of the various fields here.  This expression binds the variable
@code{hello} to a @code{<package>} object, which is essentially a record
(@pxref{SRFI-9, Scheme records,, guile, GNU Guile Reference Manual}).
This package object can be inspected using procedures found in the
@code{(guix packages)} module; for instance, @code{(package-name hello)}
returns---surprise!---@code{"hello"}.

With luck, you may be able to import part or all of the definition of
the package you are interested in from another repository, using the
@code{guix import} command (@pxref{Invoking guix import}).

In the example above, @var{hello} is defined in a module of its own,
@code{(gnu packages hello)}.  Technically, this is not strictly
necessary, but it is convenient to do so: all the packages defined in
modules under @code{(gnu packages @dots{})} are automatically known to
the command-line tools (@pxref{Package Modules}).

There are a few points worth noting in the above package definition:

@itemize
@item
The @code{source} field of the package is an @code{<origin>} object
(@pxref{origin Reference}, for the complete reference).
Here, the @code{url-fetch} method from @code{(guix download)} is used,
meaning that the source is a file to be downloaded over FTP or HTTP.

The @code{mirror://gnu} prefix instructs @code{url-fetch} to use one of
the GNU mirrors defined in @code{(guix download)}.

The @code{sha256} field specifies the expected SHA256 hash of the file
being downloaded.  It is mandatory, and allows Guix to check the
integrity of the file.  The @code{(base32 @dots{})} form introduces the
base32 representation of the hash.  You can obtain this information with
@code{guix download} (@pxref{Invoking guix download}) and @code{guix
hash} (@pxref{Invoking guix hash}).

@cindex patches
When needed, the @code{origin} form can also have a @code{patches} field
listing patches to be applied, and a @code{snippet} field giving a
Scheme expression to modify the source code.

@item
@cindex GNU Build System
The @code{build-system} field specifies the procedure to build the
package (@pxref{Build Systems}).  Here, @var{gnu-build-system}
represents the familiar GNU Build System, where packages may be
configured, built, and installed with the usual @code{./configure &&
make && make check && make install} command sequence.

@item
The @code{arguments} field specifies options for the build system
(@pxref{Build Systems}).  Here it is interpreted by
@var{gnu-build-system} as a request run @file{configure} with the
@code{--enable-silent-rules} flag.

@cindex quote
@cindex quoting
@findex '
@findex quote
What about these quote (@code{'}) characters?  They are Scheme syntax to
introduce a literal list; @code{'} is synonymous with @code{quote}.
@xref{Expression Syntax, quoting,, guile, GNU Guile Reference Manual},
for details.  Here the value of the @code{arguments} field is a list of
arguments passed to the build system down the road, as with @code{apply}
(@pxref{Fly Evaluation, @code{apply},, guile, GNU Guile Reference
Manual}).

The hash-colon (@code{#:}) sequence defines a Scheme @dfn{keyword}
(@pxref{Keywords,,, guile, GNU Guile Reference Manual}), and
@code{#:configure-flags} is a keyword used to pass a keyword argument
to the build system (@pxref{Coding With Keywords,,, guile, GNU Guile
Reference Manual}).

@item
The @code{inputs} field specifies inputs to the build process---i.e.,
build-time or run-time dependencies of the package.  Here, we define an
input called @code{"gawk"} whose value is that of the @var{gawk}
variable; @var{gawk} is itself bound to a @code{<package>} object.

@cindex backquote (quasiquote)
@findex `
@findex quasiquote
@cindex comma (unquote)
@findex ,
@findex unquote
@findex ,@@
@findex unquote-splicing
Again, @code{`} (a backquote, synonymous with @code{quasiquote}) allows
us to introduce a literal list in the @code{inputs} field, while
@code{,} (a comma, synonymous with @code{unquote}) allows us to insert a
value in that list (@pxref{Expression Syntax, unquote,, guile, GNU Guile
Reference Manual}).

Note that GCC, Coreutils, Bash, and other essential tools do not need to
be specified as inputs here.  Instead, @var{gnu-build-system} takes care
of ensuring that they are present (@pxref{Build Systems}).

However, any other dependencies need to be specified in the
@code{inputs} field.  Any dependency not specified here will simply be
unavailable to the build process, possibly leading to a build failure.
@end itemize

@xref{package Reference}, for a full description of possible fields.

Once a package definition is in place, the
package may actually be built using the @code{guix build} command-line
tool (@pxref{Invoking guix build}), troubleshooting any build failures
you encounter (@pxref{Debugging Build Failures}).  You can easily jump back to the
package definition using the @command{guix edit} command
(@pxref{Invoking guix edit}).
@xref{Packaging Guidelines}, for
more information on how to test package definitions, and
@ref{Invoking guix lint}, for information on how to check a definition
for style conformance.
@vindex GUIX_PACKAGE_PATH
Lastly, @pxref{Channels}, for information
on how to extend the distribution by adding your own package definitions
in a ``channel''.

Finally, updating the package definition to a new upstream version
can be partly automated by the @command{guix refresh} command
(@pxref{Invoking guix refresh}).

Behind the scenes, a derivation corresponding to the @code{<package>}
object is first computed by the @code{package-derivation} procedure.
That derivation is stored in a @code{.drv} file under @file{/gnu/store}.
The build actions it prescribes may then be realized by using the
@code{build-derivations} procedure (@pxref{The Store}).

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} package-derivation @var{store} @var{package} [@var{system}]
Return the @code{<derivation>} object of @var{package} for @var{system}
(@pxref{Derivations}).

@var{package} must be a valid @code{<package>} object, and @var{system}
must be a string denoting the target system type---e.g.,
@code{"x86_64-linux"} for an x86_64 Linux-based GNU system.  @var{store}
must be a connection to the daemon, which operates on the store
(@pxref{The Store}).
@end deffn

@noindent
@cindex cross-compilation
Similarly, it is possible to compute a derivation that cross-builds a
package for some other system:

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} package-cross-derivation @var{store} @
            @var{package} @var{target} [@var{system}]
Return the @code{<derivation>} object of @var{package} cross-built from
@var{system} to @var{target}.

@var{target} must be a valid GNU triplet denoting the target hardware
and operating system, such as @code{"mips64el-linux-gnu"}
(@pxref{Configuration Names, GNU configuration triplets,, configure, GNU
Configure and Build System}).
@end deffn

@cindex package transformations
@cindex input rewriting
@cindex dependency tree rewriting
Packages can be manipulated in arbitrary ways.  An example of a useful
transformation is @dfn{input rewriting}, whereby the dependency tree of
a package is rewritten by replacing specific inputs by others:

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} package-input-rewriting @var{replacements} @
           [@var{rewrite-name}]
Return a procedure that, when passed a package, replaces its direct and
indirect dependencies (but not its implicit inputs) according to
@var{replacements}.  @var{replacements} is a list of package pairs; the
first element of each pair is the package to replace, and the second one
is the replacement.

Optionally, @var{rewrite-name} is a one-argument procedure that takes
the name of a package and returns its new name after rewrite.
@end deffn

@noindent
Consider this example:

@example
(define libressl-instead-of-openssl
  ;; This is a procedure to replace OPENSSL by LIBRESSL,
  ;; recursively.
  (package-input-rewriting `((,openssl . ,libressl))))

(define git-with-libressl
  (libressl-instead-of-openssl git))
@end example

@noindent
Here we first define a rewriting procedure that replaces @var{openssl}
with @var{libressl}.  Then we use it to define a @dfn{variant} of the
@var{git} package that uses @var{libressl} instead of @var{openssl}.
This is exactly what the @option{--with-input} command-line option does
(@pxref{Package Transformation Options, @option{--with-input}}).

The following variant of @code{package-input-rewriting} can match packages to
be replaced by name rather than by identity.

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} package-input-rewriting/spec @var{replacements}
Return a procedure that, given a package, applies the given @var{replacements} to
all the package graph (excluding implicit inputs).  @var{replacements} is a list of
spec/procedures pair; each spec is a package specification such as @code{"gcc"} or
@code{"guile@@2"}, and each procedure takes a matching package and returns a
replacement for that package.
@end deffn

The example above could be rewritten this way:

@example
(define libressl-instead-of-openssl
  ;; Replace all the packages called "openssl" with LibreSSL.
  (package-input-rewriting/spec `(("openssl" . ,(const libressl)))))
@end example

The key difference here is that, this time, packages are matched by spec and
not by identity.  In other words, any package in the graph that is called
@code{openssl} will be replaced.

A more generic procedure to rewrite a package dependency graph is
@code{package-mapping}: it supports arbitrary changes to nodes in the
graph.

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} package-mapping @var{proc} [@var{cut?}]
Return a procedure that, given a package, applies @var{proc} to all the packages
depended on and returns the resulting package.  The procedure stops recursion
when @var{cut?} returns true for a given package.
@end deffn

@node package Reference
@subsection @code{package} Reference

This section summarizes all the options available in @code{package}
declarations (@pxref{Defining Packages}).

@deftp {Data Type} package
This is the data type representing a package recipe.

@table @asis
@item @code{name}
The name of the package, as a string.

@item @code{version}
The version of the package, as a string.

@item @code{source}
An object telling how the source code for the package should be
acquired.  Most of the time, this is an @code{origin} object, which
denotes a file fetched from the Internet (@pxref{origin Reference}).  It
can also be any other ``file-like'' object such as a @code{local-file},
which denotes a file from the local file system (@pxref{G-Expressions,
@code{local-file}}).

@item @code{build-system}
The build system that should be used to build the package (@pxref{Build
Systems}).

@item @code{arguments} (default: @code{'()})
The arguments that should be passed to the build system.  This is a
list, typically containing sequential keyword-value pairs.

@item @code{inputs} (default: @code{'()})
@itemx @code{native-inputs} (default: @code{'()})
@itemx @code{propagated-inputs} (default: @code{'()})
@cindex inputs, of packages
These fields list dependencies of the package.  Each one is a list of
tuples, where each tuple has a label for the input (a string) as its
first element, a package, origin, or derivation as its second element,
and optionally the name of the output thereof that should be used, which
defaults to @code{"out"} (@pxref{Packages with Multiple Outputs}, for
more on package outputs).  For example, the list below specifies three
inputs:

@example
`(("libffi" ,libffi)
  ("libunistring" ,libunistring)
  ("glib:bin" ,glib "bin"))  ;the "bin" output of Glib
@end example

@cindex cross compilation, package dependencies
The distinction between @code{native-inputs} and @code{inputs} is
necessary when considering cross-compilation.  When cross-compiling,
dependencies listed in @code{inputs} are built for the @emph{target}
architecture; conversely, dependencies listed in @code{native-inputs}
are built for the architecture of the @emph{build} machine.

@code{native-inputs} is typically used to list tools needed at
build time, but not at run time, such as Autoconf, Automake, pkg-config,
Gettext, or Bison.  @command{guix lint} can report likely mistakes in
this area (@pxref{Invoking guix lint}).

@anchor{package-propagated-inputs}
Lastly, @code{propagated-inputs} is similar to @code{inputs}, but the
specified packages will be automatically installed alongside the package
they belong to (@pxref{package-cmd-propagated-inputs, @command{guix
package}}, for information on how @command{guix package} deals with
propagated inputs.)

For example this is necessary when a C/C++ library needs headers of
another library to compile, or when a pkg-config file refers to another
one @i{via} its @code{Requires} field.

Another example where @code{propagated-inputs} is useful is for languages
that lack a facility to record the run-time search path akin to the
@code{RUNPATH} of ELF files; this includes Guile, Python, Perl, and
more.  To ensure that libraries written in those languages can find
library code they depend on at run time, run-time dependencies must be
listed in @code{propagated-inputs} rather than @code{inputs}.

@item @code{outputs} (default: @code{'("out")})
The list of output names of the package.  @xref{Packages with Multiple
Outputs}, for typical uses of additional outputs.

@item @code{native-search-paths} (default: @code{'()})
@itemx @code{search-paths} (default: @code{'()})
A list of @code{search-path-specification} objects describing
search-path environment variables honored by the package.

@item @code{replacement} (default: @code{#f})
This must be either @code{#f} or a package object that will be used as a
@dfn{replacement} for this package.  @xref{Security Updates, grafts},
for details.

@item @code{synopsis}
A one-line description of the package.

@item @code{description}
A more elaborate description of the package.

@item @code{license}
@cindex license, of packages
The license of the package; a value from @code{(guix licenses)},
or a list of such values.

@item @code{home-page}
The URL to the home-page of the package, as a string.

@item @code{supported-systems} (default: @var{%supported-systems})
The list of systems supported by the package, as strings of the form
@code{architecture-kernel}, for example @code{"x86_64-linux"}.

@item @code{maintainers} (default: @code{'()})
The list of maintainers of the package, as @code{maintainer} objects.

@item @code{location} (default: source location of the @code{package} form)
The source location of the package.  It is useful to override this when
inheriting from another package, in which case this field is not
automatically corrected.
@end table
@end deftp


@node origin Reference
@subsection @code{origin} Reference

This section summarizes all the options available in @code{origin}
declarations (@pxref{Defining Packages}).

@deftp {Data Type} origin
This is the data type representing a source code origin.

@table @asis
@item @code{uri}
An object containing the URI of the source.  The object type depends on
the @code{method} (see below).  For example, when using the
@var{url-fetch} method of @code{(guix download)}, the valid @code{uri}
values are: a URL represented as a string, or a list thereof.

@item @code{method}
A procedure that handles the URI.

Examples include:

@table @asis
@item @var{url-fetch} from @code{(guix download)}
download a file from the HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP URL specified in the
@code{uri} field;

@vindex git-fetch
@item @var{git-fetch} from @code{(guix git-download)}
clone the Git version control repository, and check out the revision
specified in the @code{uri} field as a @code{git-reference} object; a
@code{git-reference} looks like this:

@example
(git-reference
  (url "git://git.debian.org/git/pkg-shadow/shadow")
  (commit "v4.1.5.1"))
@end example
@end table

@item @code{sha256}
A bytevector containing the SHA-256 hash of the source.  Typically the
@code{base32} form is used here to generate the bytevector from a
base-32 string.

You can obtain this information using @code{guix download}
(@pxref{Invoking guix download}) or @code{guix hash} (@pxref{Invoking
guix hash}).

@item @code{file-name} (default: @code{#f})
The file name under which the source code should be saved.  When this is
@code{#f}, a sensible default value will be used in most cases.  In case
the source is fetched from a URL, the file name from the URL will be
used.  For version control checkouts, it is recommended to provide the
file name explicitly because the default is not very descriptive.

@item @code{patches} (default: @code{'()})
A list of file names, origins, or file-like objects (@pxref{G-Expressions,
file-like objects}) pointing to patches to be applied to the source.

This list of patches must be unconditional.  In particular, it cannot
depend on the value of @code{%current-system} or
@code{%current-target-system}.

@item @code{snippet} (default: @code{#f})
A G-expression (@pxref{G-Expressions}) or S-expression that will be run
in the source directory.  This is a convenient way to modify the source,
sometimes more convenient than a patch.

@item @code{patch-flags} (default: @code{'("-p1")})
A list of command-line flags that should be passed to the @code{patch}
command.

@item @code{patch-inputs} (default: @code{#f})
Input packages or derivations to the patching process.  When this is
@code{#f}, the usual set of inputs necessary for patching are provided,
such as GNU@tie{}Patch.

@item @code{modules} (default: @code{'()})
A list of Guile modules that should be loaded during the patching
process and while running the code in the @code{snippet} field.

@item @code{patch-guile} (default: @code{#f})
The Guile package that should be used in the patching process.  When
this is @code{#f}, a sensible default is used.
@end table
@end deftp


@node Build Systems
@section Build Systems

@cindex build system
Each package definition specifies a @dfn{build system} and arguments for
that build system (@pxref{Defining Packages}).  This @code{build-system}
field represents the build procedure of the package, as well as implicit
dependencies of that build procedure.

Build systems are @code{<build-system>} objects.  The interface to
create and manipulate them is provided by the @code{(guix build-system)}
module, and actual build systems are exported by specific modules.

@cindex bag (low-level package representation)
Under the hood, build systems first compile package objects to
@dfn{bags}.  A @dfn{bag} is like a package, but with less
ornamentation---in other words, a bag is a lower-level representation of
a package, which includes all the inputs of that package, including some
that were implicitly added by the build system.  This intermediate
representation is then compiled to a derivation (@pxref{Derivations}).

Build systems accept an optional list of @dfn{arguments}.  In package
definitions, these are passed @i{via} the @code{arguments} field
(@pxref{Defining Packages}).  They are typically keyword arguments
(@pxref{Optional Arguments, keyword arguments in Guile,, guile, GNU
Guile Reference Manual}).  The value of these arguments is usually
evaluated in the @dfn{build stratum}---i.e., by a Guile process launched
by the daemon (@pxref{Derivations}).

The main build system is @var{gnu-build-system}, which implements the
standard build procedure for GNU and many other packages.  It
is provided by the @code{(guix build-system gnu)} module.

@defvr {Scheme Variable} gnu-build-system
@var{gnu-build-system} represents the GNU Build System, and variants
thereof (@pxref{Configuration, configuration and makefile conventions,,
standards, GNU Coding Standards}).

@cindex build phases
In a nutshell, packages using it are configured, built, and installed with
the usual @code{./configure && make && make check && make install}
command sequence.  In practice, a few additional steps are often needed.
All these steps are split up in separate @dfn{phases},
notably@footnote{Please see the @code{(guix build gnu-build-system)}
modules for more details about the build phases.}:

@table @code
@item unpack
Unpack the source tarball, and change the current directory to the
extracted source tree.  If the source is actually a directory, copy it
to the build tree, and enter that directory.

@item patch-source-shebangs
Patch shebangs encountered in source files so they refer to the right
store file names.  For instance, this changes @code{#!/bin/sh} to
@code{#!/gnu/store/@dots{}-bash-4.3/bin/sh}.

@item configure
Run the @file{configure} script with a number of default options, such
as @code{--prefix=/gnu/store/@dots{}}, as well as the options specified
by the @code{#:configure-flags} argument.

@item build
Run @code{make} with the list of flags specified with
@code{#:make-flags}.  If the @code{#:parallel-build?} argument is true
(the default), build with @code{make -j}.

@item check
Run @code{make check}, or some other target specified with
@code{#:test-target}, unless @code{#:tests? #f} is passed.  If the
@code{#:parallel-tests?} argument is true (the default), run @code{make
check -j}.

@item install
Run @code{make install} with the flags listed in @code{#:make-flags}.

@item patch-shebangs
Patch shebangs on the installed executable files.

@item strip
Strip debugging symbols from ELF files (unless @code{#:strip-binaries?}
is false), copying them to the @code{debug} output when available
(@pxref{Installing Debugging Files}).
@end table

@vindex %standard-phases
The build-side module @code{(guix build gnu-build-system)} defines
@var{%standard-phases} as the default list of build phases.
@var{%standard-phases} is a list of symbol/procedure pairs, where the
procedure implements the actual phase.

The list of phases used for a particular package can be changed with the
@code{#:phases} parameter.  For instance, passing:

@example
#:phases (modify-phases %standard-phases (delete 'configure))
@end example

means that all the phases described above will be used, except the
@code{configure} phase.

In addition, this build system ensures that the ``standard'' environment
for GNU packages is available.  This includes tools such as GCC, libc,
Coreutils, Bash, Make, Diffutils, grep, and sed (see the @code{(guix
build-system gnu)} module for a complete list).  We call these the
@dfn{implicit inputs} of a package, because package definitions do not
have to mention them.
@end defvr

Other @code{<build-system>} objects are defined to support other
conventions and tools used by free software packages.  They inherit most
of @var{gnu-build-system}, and differ mainly in the set of inputs
implicitly added to the build process, and in the list of phases
executed.  Some of these build systems are listed below.

@defvr {Scheme Variable} ant-build-system
This variable is exported by @code{(guix build-system ant)}.  It
implements the build procedure for Java packages that can be built with
@url{http://ant.apache.org/, Ant build tool}.

It adds both @code{ant} and the @dfn{Java Development Kit} (JDK) as
provided by the @code{icedtea} package to the set of inputs.  Different
packages can be specified with the @code{#:ant} and @code{#:jdk}
parameters, respectively.

When the original package does not provide a suitable Ant build file,
the parameter @code{#:jar-name} can be used to generate a minimal Ant
build file @file{build.xml} with tasks to build the specified jar
archive.  In this case the parameter @code{#:source-dir} can be used to
specify the source sub-directory, defaulting to ``src''.

The @code{#:main-class} parameter can be used with the minimal ant 
buildfile to specify the main class of the resulting jar.  This makes the 
jar file executable.  The @code{#:test-include} parameter can be used to 
specify the list of junit tests to run. It defaults to
@code{(list "**/*Test.java")}.  The @code{#:test-exclude} can be used to
disable some tests. It defaults to @code{(list "**/Abstract*.java")},
because abstract classes cannot be run as tests.

The parameter @code{#:build-target} can be used to specify the Ant task
that should be run during the @code{build} phase.  By default the
``jar'' task will be run.

@end defvr

@defvr {Scheme Variable} android-ndk-build-system
@cindex Android distribution
@cindex Android NDK build system
This variable is exported by @code{(guix build-system android-ndk)}.  It
implements a build procedure for Android NDK (native development kit)
packages using a Guix-specific build process.

The build system assumes that packages install their public interface
(header) files to the subdirectory "include" of the "out" output and
their libraries to the subdirectory "lib" of the "out" output.

It's also assumed that the union of all the dependencies of a package
has no conflicting files.

For the time being, cross-compilation is not supported - so right now
the libraries and header files are assumed to be host tools.

@end defvr

@defvr {Scheme Variable} asdf-build-system/source
@defvrx {Scheme Variable} asdf-build-system/sbcl
@defvrx {Scheme Variable} asdf-build-system/ecl

These variables, exported by @code{(guix build-system asdf)}, implement
build procedures for Common Lisp packages using
@url{https://common-lisp.net/project/asdf/, ``ASDF''}. ASDF is a system
definition facility for Common Lisp programs and libraries.

The @code{asdf-build-system/source} system installs the packages in
source form, and can be loaded using any common lisp implementation, via
ASDF.  The others, such as @code{asdf-build-system/sbcl}, install binary
systems in the format which a particular implementation understands.
These build systems can also be used to produce executable programs, or
lisp images which contain a set of packages pre-loaded.

The build system uses naming conventions.  For binary packages, the
package name should be prefixed with the lisp implementation, such as
@code{sbcl-} for @code{asdf-build-system/sbcl}.

Additionally, the corresponding source package should be labeled using
the same convention as python packages (see @ref{Python Modules}), using
the @code{cl-} prefix.

For binary packages, each system should be defined as a Guix package.
If one package @code{origin} contains several systems, package variants
can be created in order to build all the systems.  Source packages,
which use @code{asdf-build-system/source}, may contain several systems.

In order to create executable programs and images, the build-side
procedures @code{build-program} and @code{build-image} can be used.
They should be called in a build phase after the @code{create-symlinks}
phase, so that the system which was just built can be used within the
resulting image.  @code{build-program} requires a list of Common Lisp
expressions to be passed as the @code{#:entry-program} argument.

If the system is not defined within its own @code{.asd} file of the same
name, then the @code{#:asd-file} parameter should be used to specify
which file the system is defined in.  Furthermore, if the package
defines a system for its tests in a separate file, it will be loaded
before the tests are run if it is specified by the
@code{#:test-asd-file} parameter.  If it is not set, the files
@code{<system>-tests.asd}, @code{<system>-test.asd}, @code{tests.asd},
and @code{test.asd} will be tried if they exist.

If for some reason the package must be named in a different way than the
naming conventions suggest, the @code{#:asd-system-name} parameter can
be used to specify the name of the system.

@end defvr

@defvr {Scheme Variable} cargo-build-system
@cindex Rust programming language
@cindex Cargo (Rust build system)
This variable is exported by @code{(guix build-system cargo)}.  It
supports builds of packages using Cargo, the build tool of the
@uref{https://www.rust-lang.org, Rust programming language}.

In its @code{configure} phase, this build system replaces dependencies
specified in the @file{Carto.toml} file with inputs to the Guix package.
The @code{install} phase installs the binaries, and it also installs the
source code and @file{Cargo.toml} file.
@end defvr

@cindex Clojure (programming language)
@cindex simple Clojure build system
@defvr {Scheme Variable} clojure-build-system
This variable is exported by @code{(guix build-system clojure)}.  It implements
a simple build procedure for @uref{https://clojure.org/, Clojure} packages
using plain old @code{compile} in Clojure.  Cross-compilation is not supported
yet.

It adds @code{clojure}, @code{icedtea} and @code{zip} to the set of inputs.
Different packages can be specified with the @code{#:clojure}, @code{#:jdk} and
@code{#:zip} parameters, respectively.

A list of source directories, test directories and jar names can be specified
with the @code{#:source-dirs}, @code{#:test-dirs} and @code{#:jar-names}
parameters, respectively.  Compile directory and main class can be specified
with the @code{#:compile-dir} and @code{#:main-class} parameters, respectively.
Other parameters are documented below.

This build system is an extension of @var{ant-build-system}, but with the
following phases changed:

@table @code

@item build
This phase calls @code{compile} in Clojure to compile source files and runs
@command{jar} to create jars from both source files and compiled files
according to the include list and exclude list specified in
@code{#:aot-include} and @code{#:aot-exclude}, respectively.  The exclude list
has priority over the include list.  These lists consist of symbols
representing Clojure libraries or the special keyword @code{#:all} representing
all Clojure libraries found under the source directories.  The parameter
@code{#:omit-source?} decides if source should be included into the jars.

@item check
This phase runs tests according to the include list and exclude list specified
in @code{#:test-include} and @code{#:test-exclude}, respectively.  Their
meanings are analogous to that of @code{#:aot-include} and
@code{#:aot-exclude}, except that the special keyword @code{#:all} now
stands for all Clojure libraries found under the test directories.  The
parameter @code{#:tests?} decides if tests should be run.

@item install
This phase installs all jars built previously.
@end table

Apart from the above, this build system also contains an additional phase:

@table @code

@item install-doc
This phase installs all top-level files with base name matching
@var{%doc-regex}.  A different regex can be specified with the
@code{#:doc-regex} parameter.  All files (recursively) inside the documentation
directories specified in @code{#:doc-dirs} are installed as well.
@end table
@end defvr

@defvr {Scheme Variable} cmake-build-system
This variable is exported by @code{(guix build-system cmake)}.  It
implements the build procedure for packages using the
@url{http://www.cmake.org, CMake build tool}.

It automatically adds the @code{cmake} package to the set of inputs.
Which package is used can be specified with the @code{#:cmake}
parameter.

The @code{#:configure-flags} parameter is taken as a list of flags
passed to the @command{cmake} command.  The @code{#:build-type}
parameter specifies in abstract terms the flags passed to the compiler;
it defaults to @code{"RelWithDebInfo"} (short for ``release mode with
debugging information''), which roughly means that code is compiled with
@code{-O2 -g}, as is the case for Autoconf-based packages by default.
@end defvr

@defvr {Scheme Variable} dune-build-system
This variable is exported by @code{(guix build-system dune)}.  It
supports builds of packages using @uref{https://dune.build/, Dune}, a build
tool for the OCaml programming language.  It is implemented as an extension
of the @code{ocaml-build-system} which is described below.  As such, the
@code{#:ocaml} and @code{#:findlib} parameters can be passed to this build
system.

It automatically adds the @code{dune} package to the set of inputs.
Which package is used can be specified with the @code{#:dune}
parameter.

There is no @code{configure} phase because dune packages typically don't
need to be configured.  The @code{#:build-flags} parameter is taken as a
list of flags passed to the @code{dune} command during the build.

The @code{#:jbuild?} parameter can be passed to use the @code{jbuild}
command instead of the more recent @code{dune} command while building
a package.  Its default value is @code{#f}.

The @code{#:package} parameter can be passed to specify a package name, which
is useful when a package contains multiple packages and you want to build
only one of them.  This is equivalent to passing the @code{-p} argument to
@code{dune}.
@end defvr

@defvr {Scheme Variable} go-build-system
This variable is exported by @code{(guix build-system go)}.  It
implements a build procedure for Go packages using the standard
@url{https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Compile_packages_and_dependencies,
Go build mechanisms}.

The user is expected to provide a value for the key @code{#:import-path}
and, in some cases, @code{#:unpack-path}.  The
@url{https://golang.org/doc/code.html#ImportPaths, import path}
corresponds to the file system path expected by the package's build
scripts and any referring packages, and provides a unique way to
refer to a Go package.  It is typically based on a combination of the
package source code's remote URI and file system hierarchy structure.  In
some cases, you will need to unpack the package's source code to a
different directory structure than the one indicated by the import path,
and @code{#:unpack-path} should be used in such cases.

Packages that provide Go libraries should install their source code into
the built output.  The key @code{#:install-source?}, which defaults to
@code{#t}, controls whether or not the source code is installed.  It can
be set to @code{#f} for packages that only provide executable files.
@end defvr

@defvr {Scheme Variable} glib-or-gtk-build-system
This variable is exported by @code{(guix build-system glib-or-gtk)}.  It
is intended for use with packages making use of GLib or GTK+.

This build system adds the following two phases to the ones defined by
@var{gnu-build-system}:

@table @code
@item glib-or-gtk-wrap
The phase @code{glib-or-gtk-wrap} ensures that programs in
@file{bin/} are able to find GLib ``schemas'' and
@uref{https://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/stable/gtk-running.html, GTK+
modules}.  This is achieved by wrapping the programs in launch scripts
that appropriately set the @code{XDG_DATA_DIRS} and @code{GTK_PATH}
environment variables.

It is possible to exclude specific package outputs from that wrapping
process by listing their names in the
@code{#:glib-or-gtk-wrap-excluded-outputs} parameter.  This is useful
when an output is known not to contain any GLib or GTK+ binaries, and
where wrapping would gratuitously add a dependency of that output on
GLib and GTK+.

@item glib-or-gtk-compile-schemas
The phase @code{glib-or-gtk-compile-schemas} makes sure that all
@uref{https://developer.gnome.org/gio/stable/glib-compile-schemas.html,
GSettings schemas} of GLib are compiled.  Compilation is performed by the
@command{glib-compile-schemas} program.  It is provided by the package
@code{glib:bin} which is automatically imported by the build system.
The @code{glib} package providing @command{glib-compile-schemas} can be
specified with the @code{#:glib} parameter.
@end table

Both phases are executed after the @code{install} phase.
@end defvr

@defvr {Scheme Variable} guile-build-system
This build system is for Guile packages that consist exclusively of Scheme
code and that are so lean that they don't even have a makefile, let alone a
@file{configure} script.  It compiles Scheme code using @command{guild
compile} (@pxref{Compilation,,, guile, GNU Guile Reference Manual}) and
installs the @file{.scm} and @file{.go} files in the right place.  It also
installs documentation.

This build system supports cross-compilation by using the @code{--target}
option of @command{guild compile}.

Packages built with @code{guile-build-system} must provide a Guile package in
their @code{native-inputs} field.
@end defvr

@defvr {Scheme Variable} minify-build-system
This variable is exported by @code{(guix build-system minify)}.  It
implements a minification procedure for simple JavaScript packages.

It adds @code{uglify-js} to the set of inputs and uses it to compress
all JavaScript files in the @file{src} directory.  A different minifier
package can be specified with the @code{#:uglify-js} parameter, but it
is expected that the package writes the minified code to the standard
output.

When the input JavaScript files are not all located in the @file{src}
directory, the parameter @code{#:javascript-files} can be used to
specify a list of file names to feed to the minifier.
@end defvr

@defvr {Scheme Variable} ocaml-build-system
This variable is exported by @code{(guix build-system ocaml)}.  It implements
a build procedure for @uref{https://ocaml.org, OCaml} packages, which consists
of choosing the correct set of commands to run for each package.  OCaml
packages can expect many different commands to be run.  This build system will
try some of them.

When the package has a @file{setup.ml} file present at the top-level, it will
run @code{ocaml setup.ml -configure}, @code{ocaml setup.ml -build} and
@code{ocaml setup.ml -install}.  The build system will assume that this file
was generated by @uref{http://oasis.forge.ocamlcore.org/, OASIS} and will take
care of setting the prefix and enabling tests if they are not disabled.  You
can pass configure and build flags with the @code{#:configure-flags} and
@code{#:build-flags}.  The @code{#:test-flags} key can be passed to change the
set of flags used to enable tests.  The @code{#:use-make?} key can be used to
bypass this system in the build and install phases.

When the package has a @file{configure} file, it is assumed that it is a
hand-made configure script that requires a different argument format than
in the @code{gnu-build-system}.  You can add more flags with the
@code{#:configure-flags} key.

When the package has a @file{Makefile} file (or @code{#:use-make?} is
@code{#t}), it will be used and more flags can be passed to the build and
install phases with the @code{#:make-flags} key.

Finally, some packages do not have these files and use a somewhat standard
location for its build system.  In that case, the build system will run
@code{ocaml pkg/pkg.ml} or @code{ocaml pkg/build.ml} and take care of
providing the path to the required findlib module.  Additional flags can
be passed via the @code{#:build-flags} key.  Install is taken care of by
@command{opam-installer}.  In this case, the @code{opam} package must
be added to the @code{native-inputs} field of the package definition.

Note that most OCaml packages assume they will be installed in the same
directory as OCaml, which is not what we want in guix.  In particular, they
will install @file{.so} files in their module's directory, which is usually
fine because it is in the OCaml compiler directory.  In guix though, these
libraries cannot be found and we use @code{CAML_LD_LIBRARY_PATH}.  This
variable points to @file{lib/ocaml/site-lib/stubslibs} and this is where
@file{.so} libraries should be installed.
@end defvr

@defvr {Scheme Variable} python-build-system
This variable is exported by @code{(guix build-system python)}.  It
implements the more or less standard build procedure used by Python
packages, which consists in running @code{python setup.py build} and
then @code{python setup.py install --prefix=/gnu/store/@dots{}}.

For packages that install stand-alone Python programs under @code{bin/},
it takes care of wrapping these programs so that their @code{PYTHONPATH}
environment variable points to all the Python libraries they depend on.

Which Python package is used to perform the build can be specified with
the @code{#:python} parameter.  This is a useful way to force a package
to be built for a specific version of the Python interpreter, which
might be necessary if the package is only compatible with a single
interpreter version.

By default guix calls @code{setup.py} under control of
@code{setuptools}, much like @command{pip} does.  Some packages are not
compatible with setuptools (and pip), thus you can disable this by
setting the @code{#:use-setuptools} parameter to @code{#f}.
@end defvr

@defvr {Scheme Variable} perl-build-system
This variable is exported by @code{(guix build-system perl)}.  It
implements the standard build procedure for Perl packages, which either
consists in running @code{perl Build.PL --prefix=/gnu/store/@dots{}},
followed by @code{Build} and @code{Build install}; or in running
@code{perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=/gnu/store/@dots{}}, followed by
@code{make} and @code{make install}, depending on which of
@code{Build.PL} or @code{Makefile.PL} is present in the package
distribution.  Preference is given to the former if both @code{Build.PL}
and @code{Makefile.PL} exist in the package distribution.  This
preference can be reversed by specifying @code{#t} for the
@code{#:make-maker?} parameter.

The initial @code{perl Makefile.PL} or @code{perl Build.PL} invocation
passes flags specified by the @code{#:make-maker-flags} or
@code{#:module-build-flags} parameter, respectively.

Which Perl package is used can be specified with @code{#:perl}.
@end defvr

@defvr {Scheme Variable} r-build-system
This variable is exported by @code{(guix build-system r)}.  It
implements the build procedure used by @uref{http://r-project.org, R}
packages, which essentially is little more than running @code{R CMD
INSTALL --library=/gnu/store/@dots{}} in an environment where
@code{R_LIBS_SITE} contains the paths to all R package inputs.  Tests
are run after installation using the R function
@code{tools::testInstalledPackage}.
@end defvr

@defvr {Scheme Variable} rakudo-build-system
This variable is exported by @code{(guix build-system rakudo)} It
implements the build procedure used by @uref{https://rakudo.org/,
Rakudo} for @uref{https://perl6.org/, Perl6} packages. It installs the
package to @code{/gnu/store/@dots{}/NAME-VERSION/share/perl6} and
installs the binaries, library files and the resources, as well as wrap
the files under the @code{bin/} directory.  Tests can be skipped by
passing @code{#f} to the @code{tests?} parameter.

Which rakudo package is used can be specified with @code{rakudo}.
Which perl6-tap-harness package used for the tests can be specified with
@code{#:prove6} or removed by passing @code{#f} to the
@code{with-prove6?} parameter.
Which perl6-zef package used for tests and installing can be specified
with @code{#:zef} or removed by passing @code{#f} to the
@code{with-zef?} parameter.
@end defvr

@defvr {Scheme Variable} texlive-build-system
This variable is exported by @code{(guix build-system texlive)}.  It is
used to build TeX packages in batch mode with a specified engine.  The
build system sets the @code{TEXINPUTS} variable to find all TeX source
files in the inputs.

By default it runs @code{luatex} on all files ending on @code{ins}.  A
different engine and format can be specified with the
@code{#:tex-format} argument.  Different build targets can be specified
with the @code{#:build-targets} argument, which expects a list of file
names.  The build system adds only @code{texlive-bin} and
@code{texlive-latex-base} (both from @code{(gnu packages tex}) to the
inputs.  Both can be overridden with the arguments @code{#:texlive-bin}
and @code{#:texlive-latex-base}, respectively.

The @code{#:tex-directory} parameter tells the build system where to
install the built files under the texmf tree.
@end defvr

@defvr {Scheme Variable} ruby-build-system
This variable is exported by @code{(guix build-system ruby)}.  It
implements the RubyGems build procedure used by Ruby packages, which
involves running @code{gem build} followed by @code{gem install}.

The @code{source} field of a package that uses this build system
typically references a gem archive, since this is the format that Ruby
developers use when releasing their software.  The build system unpacks
the gem archive, potentially patches the source, runs the test suite,
repackages the gem, and installs it.  Additionally, directories and
tarballs may be referenced to allow building unreleased gems from Git or
a traditional source release tarball.

Which Ruby package is used can be specified with the @code{#:ruby}
parameter.  A list of additional flags to be passed to the @command{gem}
command can be specified with the @code{#:gem-flags} parameter.
@end defvr

@defvr {Scheme Variable} waf-build-system
This variable is exported by @code{(guix build-system waf)}.  It
implements a build procedure around the @code{waf} script.  The common
phases---@code{configure}, @code{build}, and @code{install}---are
implemented by passing their names as arguments to the @code{waf}
script.

The @code{waf} script is executed by the Python interpreter.  Which
Python package is used to run the script can be specified with the
@code{#:python} parameter.
@end defvr

@defvr {Scheme Variable} scons-build-system
This variable is exported by @code{(guix build-system scons)}.  It
implements the build procedure used by the SCons software construction
tool.  This build system runs @code{scons} to build the package,
@code{scons test} to run tests, and then @code{scons install} to install
the package.

Additional flags to be passed to @code{scons} can be specified with the
@code{#:scons-flags} parameter.  The version of Python used to run SCons
can be specified by selecting the appropriate SCons package with the
@code{#:scons} parameter.
@end defvr

@defvr {Scheme Variable} haskell-build-system
This variable is exported by @code{(guix build-system haskell)}.  It
implements the Cabal build procedure used by Haskell packages, which
involves running @code{runhaskell Setup.hs configure
--prefix=/gnu/store/@dots{}} and @code{runhaskell Setup.hs build}.
Instead of installing the package by running @code{runhaskell Setup.hs
install}, to avoid trying to register libraries in the read-only
compiler store directory, the build system uses @code{runhaskell
Setup.hs copy}, followed by @code{runhaskell Setup.hs register}.  In
addition, the build system generates the package documentation by
running @code{runhaskell Setup.hs haddock}, unless @code{#:haddock? #f}
is passed.  Optional Haddock parameters can be passed with the help of
the @code{#:haddock-flags} parameter.  If the file @code{Setup.hs} is
not found, the build system looks for @code{Setup.lhs} instead.

Which Haskell compiler is used can be specified with the @code{#:haskell}
parameter which defaults to @code{ghc}.
@end defvr

@defvr {Scheme Variable} dub-build-system
This variable is exported by @code{(guix build-system dub)}.  It
implements the Dub build procedure used by D packages, which
involves running @code{dub build} and @code{dub run}.
Installation is done by copying the files manually.

Which D compiler is used can be specified with the @code{#:ldc}
parameter which defaults to @code{ldc}.
@end defvr

@defvr {Scheme Variable} emacs-build-system
This variable is exported by @code{(guix build-system emacs)}.  It
implements an installation procedure similar to the packaging system
of Emacs itself (@pxref{Packages,,, emacs, The GNU Emacs Manual}).

It first creates the @code{@var{package}-autoloads.el} file, then it
byte compiles all Emacs Lisp files.  Differently from the Emacs
packaging system, the Info documentation files are moved to the standard
documentation directory and the @file{dir} file is deleted.  Each
package is installed in its own directory under
@file{share/emacs/site-lisp/guix.d}.
@end defvr

@defvr {Scheme Variable} font-build-system
This variable is exported by @code{(guix build-system font)}.  It
implements an installation procedure for font packages where upstream
provides pre-compiled TrueType, OpenType, etc.@: font files that merely
need to be copied into place.  It copies font files to standard
locations in the output directory.
@end defvr

@defvr {Scheme Variable} meson-build-system
This variable is exported by @code{(guix build-system meson)}.  It
implements the build procedure for packages that use
@url{http://mesonbuild.com, Meson} as their build system.

It adds both Meson and @uref{https://ninja-build.org/, Ninja} to the set
of inputs, and they can be changed with the parameters @code{#:meson}
and @code{#:ninja} if needed.  The default Meson is
@code{meson-for-build}, which is special because it doesn't clear the
@code{RUNPATH} of binaries and libraries when they are installed.

This build system is an extension of @var{gnu-build-system}, but with the
following phases changed to some specific for Meson:

@table @code

@item configure
The phase runs @code{meson} with the flags specified in
@code{#:configure-flags}.  The flag @code{--build-type} is always set to
@code{plain} unless something else is specified in @code{#:build-type}.

@item build
The phase runs @code{ninja} to build the package in parallel by default, but
this can be changed with @code{#:parallel-build?}.

@item check
The phase runs @code{ninja} with the target specified in @code{#:test-target},
which is @code{"test"} by default.

@item install
The phase runs @code{ninja install} and can not be changed.
@end table

Apart from that, the build system also adds the following phases:

@table @code

@item fix-runpath
This phase ensures that all binaries can find the libraries they need.
It searches for required libraries in subdirectories of the package being
built, and adds those to @code{RUNPATH} where needed.  It also removes
references to libraries left over from the build phase by
@code{meson-for-build}, such as test dependencies, that aren't actually
required for the program to run.

@item glib-or-gtk-wrap
This phase is the phase provided by @code{glib-or-gtk-build-system}, and it
is not enabled by default.  It can be enabled with @code{#:glib-or-gtk?}.

@item glib-or-gtk-compile-schemas
This phase is the phase provided by @code{glib-or-gtk-build-system}, and it
is not enabled by default.  It can be enabled with @code{#:glib-or-gtk?}.
@end table
@end defvr

Lastly, for packages that do not need anything as sophisticated, a
``trivial'' build system is provided.  It is trivial in the sense that
it provides basically no support: it does not pull any implicit inputs,
and does not have a notion of build phases.

@defvr {Scheme Variable} trivial-build-system
This variable is exported by @code{(guix build-system trivial)}.

This build system requires a @code{#:builder} argument.  This argument
must be a Scheme expression that builds the package output(s)---as
with @code{build-expression->derivation} (@pxref{Derivations,
@code{build-expression->derivation}}).
@end defvr

@node The Store
@section The Store

@cindex store
@cindex store items
@cindex store paths

Conceptually, the @dfn{store} is the place where derivations that have
been built successfully are stored---by default, @file{/gnu/store}.
Sub-directories in the store are referred to as @dfn{store items} or
sometimes @dfn{store paths}.  The store has an associated database that
contains information such as the store paths referred to by each store
path, and the list of @emph{valid} store items---results of successful
builds.  This database resides in @file{@var{localstatedir}/guix/db},
where @var{localstatedir} is the state directory specified @i{via}
@option{--localstatedir} at configure time, usually @file{/var}.

The store is @emph{always} accessed by the daemon on behalf of its clients
(@pxref{Invoking guix-daemon}).  To manipulate the store, clients
connect to the daemon over a Unix-domain socket, send requests to it,
and read the result---these are remote procedure calls, or RPCs.

@quotation Note
Users must @emph{never} modify files under @file{/gnu/store} directly.
This would lead to inconsistencies and break the immutability
assumptions of Guix's functional model (@pxref{Introduction}).

how to check the integrity of the store and attempt recovery from
accidental modifications.
@end quotation

The @code{(guix store)} module provides procedures to connect to the
daemon, and to perform RPCs.  These are described below.  By default,
@code{open-connection}, and thus all the @command{guix} commands,
connect to the local daemon or to the URI specified by the
@code{GUIX_DAEMON_SOCKET} environment variable.

@defvr {Environment Variable} GUIX_DAEMON_SOCKET
When set, the value of this variable should be a file name or a URI
designating the daemon endpoint.  When it is a file name, it denotes a
Unix-domain socket to connect to.  In addition to file names, the
supported URI schemes are:

@table @code
@item file
@itemx unix
These are for Unix-domain sockets.
@code{file:///var/guix/daemon-socket/socket} is equivalent to
@file{/var/guix/daemon-socket/socket}.

@item guix
@cindex daemon, remote access
@cindex remote access to the daemon
@cindex daemon, cluster setup
@cindex clusters, daemon setup
These URIs denote connections over TCP/IP, without encryption nor
authentication of the remote host.  The URI must specify the host name
and optionally a port number (by default port 44146 is used):

@example
guix://master.guix.example.org:1234
@end example

This setup is suitable on local networks, such as clusters, where only
trusted nodes may connect to the build daemon at
@code{master.guix.example.org}.

The @code{--listen} option of @command{guix-daemon} can be used to
instruct it to listen for TCP connections (@pxref{Invoking guix-daemon,
@code{--listen}}).

@item ssh
@cindex SSH access to build daemons
These URIs allow you to connect to a remote daemon over
SSH@footnote{This feature requires Guile-SSH (@pxref{Requirements}).}.
A typical URL might look like this:

@example
ssh://charlie@@guix.example.org:22
@end example

As for @command{guix copy}, the usual OpenSSH client configuration files
are honored (@pxref{Invoking guix copy}).
@end table

Additional URI schemes may be supported in the future.

@c XXX: Remove this note when the protocol incurs fewer round trips
@c and when (guix derivations) no longer relies on file system access.
@quotation Note
The ability to connect to remote build daemons is considered
experimental as of @value{VERSION}.  Please get in touch with us to
share any problems or suggestions you may have (@pxref{Contributing}).
@end quotation
@end defvr

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} open-connection [@var{uri}] [#:reserve-space? #t]
Connect to the daemon over the Unix-domain socket at @var{uri} (a string).  When
@var{reserve-space?} is true, instruct it to reserve a little bit of
extra space on the file system so that the garbage collector can still
operate should the disk become full.  Return a server object.

@var{file} defaults to @var{%default-socket-path}, which is the normal
location given the options that were passed to @command{configure}.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} close-connection @var{server}
Close the connection to @var{server}.
@end deffn

@defvr {Scheme Variable} current-build-output-port
This variable is bound to a SRFI-39 parameter, which refers to the port
where build and error logs sent by the daemon should be written.
@end defvr

Procedures that make RPCs all take a server object as their first
argument.

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} valid-path? @var{server} @var{path}
@cindex invalid store items
Return @code{#t} when @var{path} designates a valid store item and
@code{#f} otherwise (an invalid item may exist on disk but still be
invalid, for instance because it is the result of an aborted or failed
build.)

A @code{&store-protocol-error} condition is raised if @var{path} is not
prefixed by the store directory (@file{/gnu/store}).
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} add-text-to-store @var{server} @var{name} @var{text} [@var{references}]
Add @var{text} under file @var{name} in the store, and return its store
path.  @var{references} is the list of store paths referred to by the
resulting store path.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} build-derivations @var{server} @var{derivations}
Build @var{derivations} (a list of @code{<derivation>} objects or
derivation paths), and return when the worker is done building them.
Return @code{#t} on success.
@end deffn

Note that the @code{(guix monads)} module provides a monad as well as
monadic versions of the above procedures, with the goal of making it
more convenient to work with code that accesses the store (@pxref{The
Store Monad}).

@node Derivations
@section Derivations

@cindex derivations
Low-level build actions and the environment in which they are performed
are represented by @dfn{derivations}.  A derivation contains the
following pieces of information:

@itemize
@item
The outputs of the derivation---derivations produce at least one file or
directory in the store, but may produce more.

@item
@cindex build-time dependencies
@cindex dependencies, build-time
The inputs of the derivations---i.e., its build-time dependencies---which may
be other derivations or plain files in the store (patches, build scripts,
etc.)

@item
The system type targeted by the derivation---e.g., @code{x86_64-linux}.

@item
The file name of a build script in the store, along with the arguments
to be passed.

@item
A list of environment variables to be defined.

@end itemize

@cindex derivation path
Derivations allow clients of the daemon to communicate build actions to
the store.  They exist in two forms: as an in-memory representation,
both on the client- and daemon-side, and as files in the store whose
name end in @code{.drv}---these files are referred to as @dfn{derivation
paths}.  Derivations paths can be passed to the @code{build-derivations}
procedure to perform the build actions they prescribe (@pxref{The
Store}).

@cindex fixed-output derivations
Operations such as file downloads and version-control checkouts for
which the expected content hash is known in advance are modeled as
@dfn{fixed-output derivations}.  Unlike regular derivations, the outputs
of a fixed-output derivation are independent of its inputs---e.g., a
source code download produces the same result regardless of the download
method and tools being used.

@cindex references
@cindex run-time dependencies
@cindex dependencies, run-time
The outputs of derivations---i.e., the build results---have a set of
@dfn{references}, as reported by the @code{references} RPC or the
@command{guix gc --references} command (@pxref{Invoking guix gc}).  References
are the set of run-time dependencies of the build results.  References are a
subset of the inputs of the derivation; this subset is automatically computed
by the build daemon by scanning all the files in the outputs.

The @code{(guix derivations)} module provides a representation of
derivations as Scheme objects, along with procedures to create and
otherwise manipulate derivations.  The lowest-level primitive to create
a derivation is the @code{derivation} procedure:

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} derivation @var{store} @var{name} @var{builder} @
  @var{args} [#:outputs '("out")] [#:hash #f] [#:hash-algo #f] @
  [#:recursive? #f] [#:inputs '()] [#:env-vars '()] @
  [#:system (%current-system)] [#:references-graphs #f] @
  [#:allowed-references #f] [#:disallowed-references #f] @
  [#:leaked-env-vars #f] [#:local-build? #f] @
  [#:substitutable? #t] [#:properties '()]
Build a derivation with the given arguments, and return the resulting
@code{<derivation>} object.

When @var{hash} and @var{hash-algo} are given, a
@dfn{fixed-output derivation} is created---i.e., one whose result is
known in advance, such as a file download.  If, in addition,
@var{recursive?} is true, then that fixed output may be an executable
file or a directory and @var{hash} must be the hash of an archive
containing this output.

When @var{references-graphs} is true, it must be a list of file
name/store path pairs.  In that case, the reference graph of each store
path is exported in the build environment in the corresponding file, in
a simple text format.

When @var{allowed-references} is true, it must be a list of store items
or outputs that the derivation's output may refer to.  Likewise,
@var{disallowed-references}, if true, must be a list of things the
outputs may @emph{not} refer to.

When @var{leaked-env-vars} is true, it must be a list of strings
denoting environment variables that are allowed to ``leak'' from the
daemon's environment to the build environment.  This is only applicable
to fixed-output derivations---i.e., when @var{hash} is true.  The main
use is to allow variables such as @code{http_proxy} to be passed to
derivations that download files.

When @var{local-build?} is true, declare that the derivation is not a
good candidate for offloading and should rather be built locally
(@pxref{Daemon Offload Setup}).  This is the case for small derivations
where the costs of data transfers would outweigh the benefits.

When @var{substitutable?} is false, declare that substitutes of the
derivation's output should not be used (@pxref{Substitutes}).  This is
useful, for instance, when building packages that capture details of the
host CPU instruction set.

@var{properties} must be an association list describing ``properties'' of the
derivation.  It is kept as-is, uninterpreted, in the derivation.
@end deffn

@noindent
Here's an example with a shell script as its builder, assuming
@var{store} is an open connection to the daemon, and @var{bash} points
to a Bash executable in the store:

@lisp
(use-modules (guix utils)
             (guix store)
             (guix derivations))

(let ((builder   ; add the Bash script to the store
        (add-text-to-store store "my-builder.sh"
                           "echo hello world > $out\n" '())))
  (derivation store "foo"
              bash `("-e" ,builder)
              #:inputs `((,bash) (,builder))
              #:env-vars '(("HOME" . "/homeless"))))
@result{} #<derivation /gnu/store/@dots{}-foo.drv => /gnu/store/@dots{}-foo>
@end lisp

As can be guessed, this primitive is cumbersome to use directly.  A
better approach is to write build scripts in Scheme, of course!  The
best course of action for that is to write the build code as a
``G-expression'', and to pass it to @code{gexp->derivation}.  For more
information, @pxref{G-Expressions}.

Once upon a time, @code{gexp->derivation} did not exist and constructing
derivations with build code written in Scheme was achieved with
@code{build-expression->derivation}, documented below.  This procedure
is now deprecated in favor of the much nicer @code{gexp->derivation}.

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} build-expression->derivation @var{store} @
       @var{name} @var{exp} @
       [#:system (%current-system)] [#:inputs '()] @
       [#:outputs '("out")] [#:hash #f] [#:hash-algo #f] @
       [#:recursive? #f] [#:env-vars '()] [#:modules '()] @
       [#:references-graphs #f] [#:allowed-references #f] @
       [#:disallowed-references #f] @
       [#:local-build? #f] [#:substitutable? #t] [#:guile-for-build #f]
Return a derivation that executes Scheme expression @var{exp} as a
builder for derivation @var{name}.  @var{inputs} must be a list of
@code{(name drv-path sub-drv)} tuples; when @var{sub-drv} is omitted,
@code{"out"} is assumed.  @var{modules} is a list of names of Guile
modules from the current search path to be copied in the store,
compiled, and made available in the load path during the execution of
@var{exp}---e.g., @code{((guix build utils) (guix build
gnu-build-system))}.

@var{exp} is evaluated in an environment where @code{%outputs} is bound
to a list of output/path pairs, and where @code{%build-inputs} is bound
to a list of string/output-path pairs made from @var{inputs}.
Optionally, @var{env-vars} is a list of string pairs specifying the name
and value of environment variables visible to the builder.  The builder
terminates by passing the result of @var{exp} to @code{exit}; thus, when
@var{exp} returns @code{#f}, the build is considered to have failed.

@var{exp} is built using @var{guile-for-build} (a derivation).  When
@var{guile-for-build} is omitted or is @code{#f}, the value of the
@code{%guile-for-build} fluid is used instead.

See the @code{derivation} procedure for the meaning of
@var{references-graphs}, @var{allowed-references},
@var{disallowed-references}, @var{local-build?}, and
@var{substitutable?}.
@end deffn

@noindent
Here's an example of a single-output derivation that creates a directory
containing one file:

@lisp
(let ((builder '(let ((out (assoc-ref %outputs "out")))
                  (mkdir out)    ; create /gnu/store/@dots{}-goo
                  (call-with-output-file (string-append out "/test")
                    (lambda (p)
                      (display '(hello guix) p))))))
  (build-expression->derivation store "goo" builder))

@result{} #<derivation /gnu/store/@dots{}-goo.drv => @dots{}>
@end lisp


@node The Store Monad
@section The Store Monad

@cindex monad

The procedures that operate on the store described in the previous
sections all take an open connection to the build daemon as their first
argument.  Although the underlying model is functional, they either have
side effects or depend on the current state of the store.

The former is inconvenient: the connection to the build daemon has to be
carried around in all those functions, making it impossible to compose
functions that do not take that parameter with functions that do.  The
latter can be problematic: since store operations have side effects
and/or depend on external state, they have to be properly sequenced.

@cindex monadic values
@cindex monadic functions
This is where the @code{(guix monads)} module comes in.  This module
provides a framework for working with @dfn{monads}, and a particularly
useful monad for our uses, the @dfn{store monad}.  Monads are a
construct that allows two things: associating ``context'' with values
(in our case, the context is the store), and building sequences of
computations (here computations include accesses to the store).  Values
in a monad---values that carry this additional context---are called
@dfn{monadic values}; procedures that return such values are called
@dfn{monadic procedures}.

Consider this ``normal'' procedure:

@example
(define (sh-symlink store)
  ;; Return a derivation that symlinks the 'bash' executable.
  (let* ((drv (package-derivation store bash))
         (out (derivation->output-path drv))
         (sh  (string-append out "/bin/bash")))
    (build-expression->derivation store "sh"
                                  `(symlink ,sh %output))))
@end example

Using @code{(guix monads)} and @code{(guix gexp)}, it may be rewritten
as a monadic function:

@example
(define (sh-symlink)
  ;; Same, but return a monadic value.
  (mlet %store-monad ((drv (package->derivation bash)))
    (gexp->derivation "sh"
                      #~(symlink (string-append #$drv "/bin/bash")
                                 #$output))))
@end example

There are several things to note in the second version: the @code{store}
parameter is now implicit and is ``threaded'' in the calls to the
@code{package->derivation} and @code{gexp->derivation} monadic
procedures, and the monadic value returned by @code{package->derivation}
is @dfn{bound} using @code{mlet} instead of plain @code{let}.

As it turns out, the call to @code{package->derivation} can even be
omitted since it will take place implicitly, as we will see later
(@pxref{G-Expressions}):

@example
(define (sh-symlink)
  (gexp->derivation "sh"
                    #~(symlink (string-append #$bash "/bin/bash")
                               #$output)))
@end example

@c See
@c <https://syntaxexclamation.wordpress.com/2014/06/26/escaping-continuations/>
@c for the funny quote.
Calling the monadic @code{sh-symlink} has no effect.  As someone once
said, ``you exit a monad like you exit a building on fire: by running''.
So, to exit the monad and get the desired effect, one must use
@code{run-with-store}:

@example
(run-with-store (open-connection) (sh-symlink))
@result{} /gnu/store/...-sh-symlink
@end example

Note that the @code{(guix monad-repl)} module extends the Guile REPL with
new ``meta-commands'' to make it easier to deal with monadic procedures:
@code{run-in-store}, and @code{enter-store-monad}.  The former is used
to ``run'' a single monadic value through the store:

@example
scheme@@(guile-user)> ,run-in-store (package->derivation hello)
$1 = #<derivation /gnu/store/@dots{}-hello-2.9.drv => @dots{}>
@end example

The latter enters a recursive REPL, where all the return values are
automatically run through the store:

@example
scheme@@(guile-user)> ,enter-store-monad
store-monad@@(guile-user) [1]> (package->derivation hello)
$2 = #<derivation /gnu/store/@dots{}-hello-2.9.drv => @dots{}>
store-monad@@(guile-user) [1]> (text-file "foo" "Hello!")
$3 = "/gnu/store/@dots{}-foo"
store-monad@@(guile-user) [1]> ,q
scheme@@(guile-user)>
@end example

@noindent
Note that non-monadic values cannot be returned in the
@code{store-monad} REPL.

The main syntactic forms to deal with monads in general are provided by
the @code{(guix monads)} module and are described below.

@deffn {Scheme Syntax} with-monad @var{monad} @var{body} ...
Evaluate any @code{>>=} or @code{return} forms in @var{body} as being
in @var{monad}.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Syntax} return @var{val}
Return a monadic value that encapsulates @var{val}.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Syntax} >>= @var{mval} @var{mproc} ...
@dfn{Bind} monadic value @var{mval}, passing its ``contents'' to monadic
procedures @var{mproc}@dots{}@footnote{This operation is commonly
referred to as ``bind'', but that name denotes an unrelated procedure in
Guile.  Thus we use this somewhat cryptic symbol inherited from the
Haskell language.}.  There can be one @var{mproc} or several of them, as
in this example:

@example
(run-with-state
    (with-monad %state-monad
      (>>= (return 1)
           (lambda (x) (return (+ 1 x)))
           (lambda (x) (return (* 2 x)))))
  'some-state)

@result{} 4
@result{} some-state
@end example
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Syntax} mlet @var{monad} ((@var{var} @var{mval}) ...) @
       @var{body} ...
@deffnx {Scheme Syntax} mlet* @var{monad} ((@var{var} @var{mval}) ...) @
       @var{body} ...
Bind the variables @var{var} to the monadic values @var{mval} in
@var{body}, which is a sequence of expressions.  As with the bind
operator, this can be thought of as ``unpacking'' the raw, non-monadic
value ``contained'' in @var{mval} and making @var{var} refer to that
raw, non-monadic value within the scope of the @var{body}.  The form
(@var{var} -> @var{val}) binds @var{var} to the ``normal'' value
@var{val}, as per @code{let}.  The binding operations occur in sequence
from left to right.  The last expression of @var{body} must be a monadic
expression, and its result will become the result of the @code{mlet} or
@code{mlet*} when run in the @var{monad}.

@code{mlet*} is to @code{mlet} what @code{let*} is to @code{let}
(@pxref{Local Bindings,,, guile, GNU Guile Reference Manual}).
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme System} mbegin @var{monad} @var{mexp} ...
Bind @var{mexp} and the following monadic expressions in sequence,
returning the result of the last expression.  Every expression in the
sequence must be a monadic expression.

This is akin to @code{mlet}, except that the return values of the
monadic expressions are ignored.  In that sense, it is analogous to
@code{begin}, but applied to monadic expressions.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme System} mwhen @var{condition} @var{mexp0} @var{mexp*} ...
When @var{condition} is true, evaluate the sequence of monadic
expressions @var{mexp0}..@var{mexp*} as in an @code{mbegin}.  When
@var{condition} is false, return @code{*unspecified*} in the current
monad.  Every expression in the sequence must be a monadic expression.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme System} munless @var{condition} @var{mexp0} @var{mexp*} ...
When @var{condition} is false, evaluate the sequence of monadic
expressions @var{mexp0}..@var{mexp*} as in an @code{mbegin}.  When
@var{condition} is true, return @code{*unspecified*} in the current
monad.  Every expression in the sequence must be a monadic expression.
@end deffn

@cindex state monad
The @code{(guix monads)} module provides the @dfn{state monad}, which
allows an additional value---the state---to be @emph{threaded} through
monadic procedure calls.

@defvr {Scheme Variable} %state-monad
The state monad.  Procedures in the state monad can access and change
the state that is threaded.

Consider the example below.  The @code{square} procedure returns a value
in the state monad.  It returns the square of its argument, but also
increments the current state value:

@example
(define (square x)
  (mlet %state-monad ((count (current-state)))
    (mbegin %state-monad
      (set-current-state (+ 1 count))
      (return (* x x)))))

(run-with-state (sequence %state-monad (map square (iota 3))) 0)
@result{} (0 1 4)
@result{} 3
@end example

When ``run'' through @var{%state-monad}, we obtain that additional state
value, which is the number of @code{square} calls.
@end defvr

@deffn {Monadic Procedure} current-state
Return the current state as a monadic value.
@end deffn

@deffn {Monadic Procedure} set-current-state @var{value}
Set the current state to @var{value} and return the previous state as a
monadic value.
@end deffn

@deffn {Monadic Procedure} state-push @var{value}
Push @var{value} to the current state, which is assumed to be a list,
and return the previous state as a monadic value.
@end deffn

@deffn {Monadic Procedure} state-pop
Pop a value from the current state and return it as a monadic value.
The state is assumed to be a list.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} run-with-state @var{mval} [@var{state}]
Run monadic value @var{mval} starting with @var{state} as the initial
state.  Return two values: the resulting value, and the resulting state.
@end deffn

The main interface to the store monad, provided by the @code{(guix
store)} module, is as follows.

@defvr {Scheme Variable} %store-monad
The store monad---an alias for @var{%state-monad}.

Values in the store monad encapsulate accesses to the store.  When its
effect is needed, a value of the store monad must be ``evaluated'' by
passing it to the @code{run-with-store} procedure (see below.)
@end defvr

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} run-with-store @var{store} @var{mval} [#:guile-for-build] [#:system (%current-system)]
Run @var{mval}, a monadic value in the store monad, in @var{store}, an
open store connection.
@end deffn

@deffn {Monadic Procedure} text-file @var{name} @var{text} [@var{references}]
Return as a monadic value the absolute file name in the store of the file
containing @var{text}, a string.  @var{references} is a list of store items that the
resulting text file refers to; it defaults to the empty list.
@end deffn

@deffn {Monadic Procedure} binary-file @var{name} @var{data} [@var{references}]
Return as a monadic value the absolute file name in the store of the file
containing @var{data}, a bytevector.  @var{references} is a list of store
items that the resulting binary file refers to; it defaults to the empty list.
@end deffn

@deffn {Monadic Procedure} interned-file @var{file} [@var{name}] @
         [#:recursive? #t] [#:select? (const #t)]
Return the name of @var{file} once interned in the store.  Use
@var{name} as its store name, or the basename of @var{file} if
@var{name} is omitted.

When @var{recursive?} is true, the contents of @var{file} are added
recursively; if @var{file} designates a flat file and @var{recursive?}
is true, its contents are added, and its permission bits are kept.

When @var{recursive?} is true, call @code{(@var{select?} @var{file}
@var{stat})} for each directory entry, where @var{file} is the entry's
absolute file name and @var{stat} is the result of @code{lstat}; exclude
entries for which @var{select?} does not return true.

The example below adds a file to the store, under two different names:

@example
(run-with-store (open-connection)
  (mlet %store-monad ((a (interned-file "README"))
                      (b (interned-file "README" "LEGU-MIN")))
    (return (list a b))))

@result{} ("/gnu/store/rwm@dots{}-README" "/gnu/store/44i@dots{}-LEGU-MIN")
@end example

@end deffn

The @code{(guix packages)} module exports the following package-related
monadic procedures:

@node G-Expressions
@section G-Expressions

@cindex G-expression
@cindex build code quoting
So we have ``derivations'', which represent a sequence of build actions
to be performed to produce an item in the store (@pxref{Derivations}).
These build actions are performed when asking the daemon to actually
build the derivations; they are run by the daemon in a container
(@pxref{Invoking guix-daemon}).

@cindex strata of code
It should come as no surprise that we like to write these build actions
in Scheme.  When we do that, we end up with two @dfn{strata} of Scheme
code@footnote{The term @dfn{stratum} in this context was coined by
Manuel Serrano et al.@: in the context of their work on Hop.  Oleg
Kiselyov, who has written insightful
@url{http://okmij.org/ftp/meta-programming/#meta-scheme, essays and code
on this topic}, refers to this kind of code generation as
@dfn{staging}.}: the ``host code''---code that defines packages, talks
to the daemon, etc.---and the ``build code''---code that actually
performs build actions, such as making directories, invoking
@command{make}, etc.

To describe a derivation and its build actions, one typically needs to
embed build code inside host code.  It boils down to manipulating build
code as data, and the homoiconicity of Scheme---code has a direct
representation as data---comes in handy for that.  But we need more than
the normal @code{quasiquote} mechanism in Scheme to construct build
expressions.

The @code{(guix gexp)} module implements @dfn{G-expressions}, a form of
S-expressions adapted to build expressions.  G-expressions, or
@dfn{gexps}, consist essentially of three syntactic forms: @code{gexp},
@code{ungexp}, and @code{ungexp-splicing} (or simply: @code{#~},
@code{#$}, and @code{#$@@}), which are comparable to
@code{quasiquote}, @code{unquote}, and @code{unquote-splicing},
respectively (@pxref{Expression Syntax, @code{quasiquote},, guile,
GNU Guile Reference Manual}).  However, there are major differences:

@itemize
@item
Gexps are meant to be written to a file and run or manipulated by other
processes.

@item
When a high-level object such as a package or derivation is unquoted
inside a gexp, the result is as if its output file name had been
introduced.

@item
Gexps carry information about the packages or derivations they refer to,
and these dependencies are automatically added as inputs to the build
processes that use them.
@end itemize

@cindex lowering, of high-level objects in gexps
This mechanism is not limited to package and derivation
objects: @dfn{compilers} able to ``lower'' other high-level objects to
derivations or files in the store can be defined,
such that these objects can also be inserted
into gexps.  For example, a useful type of high-level objects that can be
inserted in a gexp is ``file-like objects'', which make it easy to
add files to the store and to refer to them in
derivations and such (see @code{local-file} and @code{plain-file}
below.)

To illustrate the idea, here is an example of a gexp:

@example
(define build-exp
  #~(begin
      (mkdir #$output)
      (chdir #$output)
      (symlink (string-append #$coreutils "/bin/ls")
               "list-files")))
@end example

This gexp can be passed to @code{gexp->derivation}; we obtain a
derivation that builds a directory containing exactly one symlink to
@file{/gnu/store/@dots{}-coreutils-8.22/bin/ls}:

@example
(gexp->derivation "the-thing" build-exp)
@end example

As one would expect, the @code{"/gnu/store/@dots{}-coreutils-8.22"} string is
substituted to the reference to the @var{coreutils} package in the
actual build code, and @var{coreutils} is automatically made an input to
the derivation.  Likewise, @code{#$output} (equivalent to @code{(ungexp
output)}) is replaced by a string containing the directory name of the
output of the derivation.

@cindex cross compilation
In a cross-compilation context, it is useful to distinguish between
references to the @emph{native} build of a package---that can run on the
host---versus references to cross builds of a package.  To that end, the
@code{#+} plays the same role as @code{#$}, but is a reference to a
native package build:

@example
(gexp->derivation "vi"
   #~(begin
       (mkdir #$output)
       (system* (string-append #+coreutils "/bin/ln")
                "-s"
                (string-append #$emacs "/bin/emacs")
                (string-append #$output "/bin/vi")))
   #:target "mips64el-linux-gnu")
@end example

@noindent
In the example above, the native build of @var{coreutils} is used, so
that @command{ln} can actually run on the host; but then the
cross-compiled build of @var{emacs} is referenced.

@cindex imported modules, for gexps
@findex with-imported-modules
Another gexp feature is @dfn{imported modules}: sometimes you want to be
able to use certain Guile modules from the ``host environment'' in the
gexp, so those modules should be imported in the ``build environment''.
The @code{with-imported-modules} form allows you to express that:

@example
(let ((build (with-imported-modules '((guix build utils))
               #~(begin
                   (use-modules (guix build utils))
                   (mkdir-p (string-append #$output "/bin"))))))
  (gexp->derivation "empty-dir"
                    #~(begin
                        #$build
                        (display "success!\n")
                        #t)))
@end example

@noindent
In this example, the @code{(guix build utils)} module is automatically
pulled into the isolated build environment of our gexp, such that
@code{(use-modules (guix build utils))} works as expected.

@cindex module closure
@findex source-module-closure
Usually you want the @emph{closure} of the module to be imported---i.e.,
the module itself and all the modules it depends on---rather than just
the module; failing to do that, attempts to use the module will fail
because of missing dependent modules.  The @code{source-module-closure}
procedure computes the closure of a module by looking at its source file
headers, which comes in handy in this case:

@example
(use-modules (guix modules))   ;for 'source-module-closure'

(with-imported-modules (source-module-closure
                         '((guix build utils)
                           (gnu build vm)))
  (gexp->derivation "something-with-vms"
                    #~(begin
                        (use-modules (guix build utils)
                                     (gnu build vm))
                        @dots{})))
@end example

@cindex extensions, for gexps
@findex with-extensions
In the same vein, sometimes you want to import not just pure-Scheme
modules, but also ``extensions'' such as Guile bindings to C libraries
or other ``full-blown'' packages.  Say you need the @code{guile-json}
package available on the build side, here's how you would do it:

@example
(use-modules (gnu packages guile))  ;for 'guile-json'

(with-extensions (list guile-json)
  (gexp->derivation "something-with-json"
                    #~(begin
                        (use-modules (json))
                        @dots{})))
@end example

The syntactic form to construct gexps is summarized below.

@deffn {Scheme Syntax} #~@var{exp}
@deffnx {Scheme Syntax} (gexp @var{exp})
Return a G-expression containing @var{exp}.  @var{exp} may contain one
or more of the following forms:

@table @code
@item #$@var{obj}
@itemx (ungexp @var{obj})
Introduce a reference to @var{obj}.  @var{obj} may have one of the
supported types, for example a package or a
derivation, in which case the @code{ungexp} form is replaced by its
output file name---e.g., @code{"/gnu/store/@dots{}-coreutils-8.22}.

If @var{obj} is a list, it is traversed and references to supported
objects are substituted similarly.

If @var{obj} is another gexp, its contents are inserted and its
dependencies are added to those of the containing gexp.

If @var{obj} is another kind of object, it is inserted as is.

@item #$@var{obj}:@var{output}
@itemx (ungexp @var{obj} @var{output})
This is like the form above, but referring explicitly to the
@var{output} of @var{obj}---this is useful when @var{obj} produces
multiple outputs (@pxref{Packages with Multiple Outputs}).

@item #+@var{obj}
@itemx #+@var{obj}:output
@itemx (ungexp-native @var{obj})
@itemx (ungexp-native @var{obj} @var{output})
Same as @code{ungexp}, but produces a reference to the @emph{native}
build of @var{obj} when used in a cross compilation context.

@item #$output[:@var{output}]
@itemx (ungexp output [@var{output}])
Insert a reference to derivation output @var{output}, or to the main
output when @var{output} is omitted.

This only makes sense for gexps passed to @code{gexp->derivation}.

@item #$@@@var{lst}
@itemx (ungexp-splicing @var{lst})
Like the above, but splices the contents of @var{lst} inside the
containing list.

@item #+@@@var{lst}
@itemx (ungexp-native-splicing @var{lst})
Like the above, but refers to native builds of the objects listed in
@var{lst}.

@end table

G-expressions created by @code{gexp} or @code{#~} are run-time objects
of the @code{gexp?} type (see below.)
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Syntax} with-imported-modules @var{modules} @var{body}@dots{}
Mark the gexps defined in @var{body}@dots{} as requiring @var{modules}
in their execution environment.

Each item in @var{modules} can be the name of a module, such as
@code{(guix build utils)}, or it can be a module name, followed by an
arrow, followed by a file-like object:

@example
`((guix build utils)
  (guix gcrypt)
  ((guix config) => ,(scheme-file "config.scm"
                                  #~(define-module @dots{}))))
@end example

@noindent
In the example above, the first two modules are taken from the search
path, and the last one is created from the given file-like object.

This form has @emph{lexical} scope: it has an effect on the gexps
directly defined in @var{body}@dots{}, but not on those defined, say, in
procedures called from @var{body}@dots{}.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Syntax} with-extensions @var{extensions} @var{body}@dots{}
Mark the gexps defined in @var{body}@dots{} as requiring
@var{extensions} in their build and execution environment.
@var{extensions} is typically a list of package objects such as those
defined in the @code{(gnu packages guile)} module.

Concretely, the packages listed in @var{extensions} are added to the
load path while compiling imported modules in @var{body}@dots{}; they
are also added to the load path of the gexp returned by
@var{body}@dots{}.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} gexp? @var{obj}
Return @code{#t} if @var{obj} is a G-expression.
@end deffn

G-expressions are meant to be written to disk, either as code building
some derivation, or as plain files in the store.  The monadic procedures
below allow you to do that (@pxref{The Store Monad}, for more
information about monads.)

@deffn {Monadic Procedure} gexp->derivation @var{name} @var{exp} @
       [#:system (%current-system)] [#:target #f] [#:graft? #t] @
       [#:hash #f] [#:hash-algo #f] @
       [#:recursive? #f] [#:env-vars '()] [#:modules '()] @
       [#:module-path @var{%load-path}] @
       [#:effective-version "2.2"] @
       [#:references-graphs #f] [#:allowed-references #f] @
       [#:disallowed-references #f] @
       [#:leaked-env-vars #f] @
       [#:script-name (string-append @var{name} "-builder")] @
       [#:deprecation-warnings #f] @
       [#:local-build? #f] [#:substitutable? #t] @
       [#:properties '()] [#:guile-for-build #f]
Return a derivation @var{name} that runs @var{exp} (a gexp) with
@var{guile-for-build} (a derivation) on @var{system}; @var{exp} is
stored in a file called @var{script-name}.  When @var{target} is true,
it is used as the cross-compilation target triplet for packages referred
to by @var{exp}.

@var{modules} is deprecated in favor of @code{with-imported-modules}.
Its meaning is to
make @var{modules} available in the evaluation context of @var{exp};
@var{modules} is a list of names of Guile modules searched in
@var{module-path} to be copied in the store, compiled, and made available in
the load path during the execution of @var{exp}---e.g., @code{((guix
build utils) (guix build gnu-build-system))}.

@var{effective-version} determines the string to use when adding extensions of
@var{exp} (see @code{with-extensions}) to the search path---e.g., @code{"2.2"}.

@var{graft?} determines whether packages referred to by @var{exp} should be grafted when
applicable.

When @var{references-graphs} is true, it must be a list of tuples of one of the
following forms:

@example
(@var{file-name} @var{package})
(@var{file-name} @var{package} @var{output})
(@var{file-name} @var{derivation})
(@var{file-name} @var{derivation} @var{output})
(@var{file-name} @var{store-item})
@end example

The right-hand-side of each element of @var{references-graphs} is automatically made
an input of the build process of @var{exp}.  In the build environment, each
@var{file-name} contains the reference graph of the corresponding item, in a simple
text format.

@var{allowed-references} must be either @code{#f} or a list of output names and packages.
In the latter case, the list denotes store items that the result is allowed to
refer to.  Any reference to another store item will lead to a build error.
Similarly for @var{disallowed-references}, which can list items that must not be
referenced by the outputs.

@var{deprecation-warnings} determines whether to show deprecation warnings while
compiling modules.  It can be @code{#f}, @code{#t}, or @code{'detailed}.

The other arguments are as for @code{derivation} (@pxref{Derivations}).
@end deffn

@cindex file-like objects
The @code{local-file}, @code{plain-file}, @code{computed-file},
@code{program-file}, and @code{scheme-file} procedures below return
@dfn{file-like objects}.  That is, when unquoted in a G-expression,
these objects lead to a file in the store.  Consider this G-expression:

@example
#~(system* #$(file-append glibc "/sbin/nscd") "-f"
           #$(local-file "/tmp/my-nscd.conf"))
@end example

The effect here is to ``intern'' @file{/tmp/my-nscd.conf} by copying it
to the store.  Once expanded, for instance @i{via}
@code{gexp->derivation}, the G-expression refers to that copy under
@file{/gnu/store}; thus, modifying or removing the file in @file{/tmp}
does not have any effect on what the G-expression does.
@code{plain-file} can be used similarly; it differs in that the file
content is directly passed as a string.

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} local-file @var{file} [@var{name}] @
   [#:recursive? #f] [#:select? (const #t)]
Return an object representing local file @var{file} to add to the store; this
object can be used in a gexp.  If @var{file} is a relative file name, it is looked
up relative to the source file where this form appears.  @var{file} will be added to
the store under @var{name}--by default the base name of @var{file}.

When @var{recursive?} is true, the contents of @var{file} are added recursively; if @var{file}
designates a flat file and @var{recursive?} is true, its contents are added, and its
permission bits are kept.

When @var{recursive?} is true, call @code{(@var{select?} @var{file}
@var{stat})} for each directory entry, where @var{file} is the entry's
absolute file name and @var{stat} is the result of @code{lstat}; exclude
entries for which @var{select?} does not return true.

This is the declarative counterpart of the @code{interned-file} monadic
procedure (@pxref{The Store Monad, @code{interned-file}}).
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} plain-file @var{name} @var{content}
Return an object representing a text file called @var{name} with the given
@var{content} (a string or a bytevector) to be added to the store.

This is the declarative counterpart of @code{text-file}.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} computed-file @var{name} @var{gexp} @
          [#:options '(#:local-build? #t)]
Return an object representing the store item @var{name}, a file or
directory computed by @var{gexp}.  @var{options}
is a list of additional arguments to pass to @code{gexp->derivation}.

This is the declarative counterpart of @code{gexp->derivation}.
@end deffn

@deffn {Monadic Procedure} gexp->script @var{name} @var{exp} @
  [#:guile (default-guile)] [#:module-path %load-path]
Return an executable script @var{name} that runs @var{exp} using
@var{guile}, with @var{exp}'s imported modules in its search path.
Look up @var{exp}'s modules in @var{module-path}.

The example below builds a script that simply invokes the @command{ls}
command:

@example
(use-modules (guix gexp) (gnu packages base))

(gexp->script "list-files"
              #~(execl #$(file-append coreutils "/bin/ls")
                       "ls"))
@end example

When ``running'' it through the store (@pxref{The Store Monad,
@code{run-with-store}}), we obtain a derivation that produces an
executable file @file{/gnu/store/@dots{}-list-files} along these lines:

@example
#!/gnu/store/@dots{}-guile-2.0.11/bin/guile -ds
!#
(execl "/gnu/store/@dots{}-coreutils-8.22"/bin/ls" "ls")
@end example
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} program-file @var{name} @var{exp} @
          [#:guile #f] [#:module-path %load-path]
Return an object representing the executable store item @var{name} that
runs @var{gexp}.  @var{guile} is the Guile package used to execute that
script.  Imported modules of @var{gexp} are looked up in @var{module-path}.

This is the declarative counterpart of @code{gexp->script}.
@end deffn

@deffn {Monadic Procedure} gexp->file @var{name} @var{exp} @
            [#:set-load-path? #t] [#:module-path %load-path] @
            [#:splice? #f] @
            [#:guile (default-guile)]
Return a derivation that builds a file @var{name} containing @var{exp}.
When @var{splice?}  is true, @var{exp} is considered to be a list of
expressions that will be spliced in the resulting file.

When @var{set-load-path?} is true, emit code in the resulting file to
set @code{%load-path} and @code{%load-compiled-path} to honor
@var{exp}'s imported modules.  Look up @var{exp}'s modules in
@var{module-path}.

The resulting file holds references to all the dependencies of @var{exp}
or a subset thereof.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} scheme-file @var{name} @var{exp} [#:splice? #f]
Return an object representing the Scheme file @var{name} that contains
@var{exp}.

This is the declarative counterpart of @code{gexp->file}.
@end deffn

@deffn {Monadic Procedure} text-file* @var{name} @var{text} @dots{}
Return as a monadic value a derivation that builds a text file
containing all of @var{text}.  @var{text} may list, in addition to
strings, objects of any type that can be used in a gexp: packages,
derivations, local file objects, etc.  The resulting store file holds
references to all these.

This variant should be preferred over @code{text-file} anytime the file
to create will reference items from the store.  This is typically the
case when building a configuration file that embeds store file names,
like this:

@example
(define (profile.sh)
  ;; Return the name of a shell script in the store that
  ;; initializes the 'PATH' environment variable.
  (text-file* "profile.sh"
              "export PATH=" coreutils "/bin:"
              grep "/bin:" sed "/bin\n"))
@end example

In this example, the resulting @file{/gnu/store/@dots{}-profile.sh} file
will reference @var{coreutils}, @var{grep}, and @var{sed}, thereby
preventing them from being garbage-collected during its lifetime.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} mixed-text-file @var{name} @var{text} @dots{}
Return an object representing store file @var{name} containing
@var{text}.  @var{text} is a sequence of strings and file-like objects,
as in:

@example
(mixed-text-file "profile"
                 "export PATH=" coreutils "/bin:" grep "/bin")
@end example

This is the declarative counterpart of @code{text-file*}.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} file-union @var{name} @var{files}
Return a @code{<computed-file>} that builds a directory containing all of @var{files}.
Each item in @var{files} must be a two-element list where the first element is the
file name to use in the new directory, and the second element is a gexp
denoting the target file.  Here's an example:

@example
(file-union "etc"
            `(("hosts" ,(plain-file "hosts"
                                    "127.0.0.1 localhost"))
              ("bashrc" ,(plain-file "bashrc"
                                     "alias ls='ls --color=auto'"))))
@end example

This yields an @code{etc} directory containing these two files.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} directory-union @var{name} @var{things}
Return a directory that is the union of @var{things}, where @var{things} is a list of
file-like objects denoting directories.  For example:

@example
(directory-union "guile+emacs" (list guile emacs))
@end example

yields a directory that is the union of the @code{guile} and @code{emacs} packages.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} file-append @var{obj} @var{suffix} @dots{}
Return a file-like object that expands to the concatenation of @var{obj}
and @var{suffix}, where @var{obj} is a lowerable object and each
@var{suffix} is a string.

As an example, consider this gexp:

@example
(gexp->script "run-uname"
              #~(system* #$(file-append coreutils
                                        "/bin/uname")))
@end example

The same effect could be achieved with:

@example
(gexp->script "run-uname"
              #~(system* (string-append #$coreutils
                                        "/bin/uname")))
@end example

There is one difference though: in the @code{file-append} case, the
resulting script contains the absolute file name as a string, whereas in
the second case, the resulting script contains a @code{(string-append
@dots{})} expression to construct the file name @emph{at run time}.
@end deffn


Of course, in addition to gexps embedded in ``host'' code, there are
also modules containing build tools.  To make it clear that they are
meant to be used in the build stratum, these modules are kept in the
@code{(guix build @dots{})} name space.

@cindex lowering, of high-level objects in gexps
Internally, high-level objects are @dfn{lowered}, using their compiler,
to either derivations or store items.  For instance, lowering a package
yields a derivation, and lowering a @code{plain-file} yields a store
item.  This is achieved using the @code{lower-object} monadic procedure.

@deffn {Monadic Procedure} lower-object @var{obj} [@var{system}] @
           [#:target #f]
Return as a value in @var{%store-monad} the derivation or store item
corresponding to @var{obj} for @var{system}, cross-compiling for
@var{target} if @var{target} is true.  @var{obj} must be an object that
has an associated gexp compiler, such as a @code{<package>}.
@end deffn

@cindex REPL, read-eval-print loop
The @command{guix repl} command spawns a Guile @dfn{read-eval-print loop}
(REPL) for interactive programming (@pxref{Using Guile Interactively,,, guile,
GNU Guile Reference Manual}).  Compared to just launching the @command{guile}
command, @command{guix repl} guarantees that all the Guix modules and all its
dependencies are available in the search path.  You can use it this way:

@example
$ guix repl
scheme@@(guile-user)> ,use (gnu packages base)
scheme@@(guile-user)> coreutils
$1 = #<package coreutils@@8.29 gnu/packages/base.scm:327 3e28300>
@end example

@cindex inferiors
In addition, @command{guix repl} implements a simple machine-readable REPL
protocol for use by @code{(guix inferior)}, a facility to interact with
@dfn{inferiors}, separate processes running a potentially different revision
of Guix.

The available options are as follows:

@table @code
@item --type=@var{type}
@itemx -t @var{type}
Start a REPL of the given @var{TYPE}, which can be one of the following:

@table @code
@item guile
This is default, and it spawns a standard full-featured Guile REPL.
@item machine
Spawn a REPL that uses the machine-readable protocol.  This is the protocol
that the @code{(guix inferior)} module speaks.
@end table

@item --listen=@var{endpoint}
By default, @command{guix repl} reads from standard input and writes to
standard output.  When this option is passed, it will instead listen for
connections on @var{endpoint}.  Here are examples of valid options:

@table @code
@item --listen=tcp:37146
Accept connections on localhost on port 37146.

@item --listen=unix:/tmp/socket
Accept connections on the Unix-domain socket @file{/tmp/socket}.

@node Invoking guix build
@section Invoking @command{guix build}

@cindex package building
@cindex @command{guix build}
The @command{guix build} command builds packages or derivations and
their dependencies, and prints the resulting store paths.  Note that it
does not modify the user's profile---this is the job of the
@command{guix package} command (@pxref{Invoking guix package}).  Thus,
it is mainly useful for distribution developers.

The general syntax is:

@example
guix build @var{options} @var{package-or-derivation}@dots{}
@end example

As an example, the following command builds the latest versions of Emacs
and of Guile, displays their build logs, and finally displays the
resulting directories:

@example
guix build emacs guile
@end example

Similarly, the following command builds all the available packages:

@example
guix build --quiet --keep-going \
  `guix package -A | cut -f1,2 --output-delimiter=@@`
@end example

@var{package-or-derivation} may be either the name of a package found in
the software distribution such as @code{coreutils} or
@code{coreutils@@8.20}, or a derivation such as
@file{/gnu/store/@dots{}-coreutils-8.19.drv}.  In the former case, a
package with the corresponding name (and optionally version) is searched
for among the GNU distribution modules (@pxref{Package Modules}).

Alternatively, the @code{--expression} option may be used to specify a
Scheme expression that evaluates to a package; this is useful when
disambiguating among several same-named packages or package variants is
needed.

There may be zero or more @var{options}.  The available options are
described in the subsections below.

@menu
* Common Build Options::        Build options for most commands.
* Package Transformation Options::  Creating variants of packages.
* Additional Build Options::    Options specific to 'guix build'.
* Debugging Build Failures::    Real life packaging experience.
@end menu

@node Common Build Options
@subsection Common Build Options

A number of options that control the build process are common to
@command{guix build} and other commands that can spawn builds, such as
@command{guix package} or @command{guix archive}.  These are the
following:

@table @code

@item --load-path=@var{directory}
@itemx -L @var{directory}
Add @var{directory} to the front of the package module search path
(@pxref{Package Modules}).

This allows users to define their own packages and make them visible to
the command-line tools.

@item --keep-failed
@itemx -K
Keep the build tree of failed builds.  Thus, if a build fails, its build
tree is kept under @file{/tmp}, in a directory whose name is shown at
the end of the build log.  This is useful when debugging build issues.
@xref{Debugging Build Failures}, for tips and tricks on how to debug
build issues.

This option has no effect when connecting to a remote daemon with a
@code{guix://} URI (@pxref{The Store, the @code{GUIX_DAEMON_SOCKET}
variable}).

@item --keep-going
@itemx -k
Keep going when some of the derivations fail to build; return only once
all the builds have either completed or failed.

The default behavior is to stop as soon as one of the specified
derivations has failed.

@item --dry-run
@itemx -n
Do not build the derivations.

@anchor{fallback-option}
@item --fallback
When substituting a pre-built binary fails, fall back to building
packages locally (@pxref{Substitution Failure}).

@item --substitute-urls=@var{urls}
@anchor{client-substitute-urls}
Consider @var{urls} the whitespace-separated list of substitute source
URLs, overriding the default list of URLs of @command{guix-daemon}
(@pxref{daemon-substitute-urls,, @command{guix-daemon} URLs}).

This means that substitutes may be downloaded from @var{urls}, provided
they are signed by a key authorized by the system administrator
(@pxref{Substitutes}).

When @var{urls} is the empty string, substitutes are effectively
disabled.

@item --no-substitutes
Do not use substitutes for build products.  That is, always build things
locally instead of allowing downloads of pre-built binaries
(@pxref{Substitutes}).

@item --no-grafts
Do not ``graft'' packages.  In practice, this means that package updates
available as grafts are not applied.  @xref{Security Updates}, for more
information on grafts.

@item --rounds=@var{n}
Build each derivation @var{n} times in a row, and raise an error if
consecutive build results are not bit-for-bit identical.

This is a useful way to detect non-deterministic builds processes.
Non-deterministic build processes are a problem because they make it
practically impossible for users to @emph{verify} whether third-party
binaries are genuine.  @xref{Invoking guix challenge}, for more.

Note that, currently, the differing build results are not kept around,
so you will have to manually investigate in case of an error---e.g., by
stashing one of the build results with @code{guix archive --export}
(@pxref{Invoking guix archive}), then rebuilding, and finally comparing
the two results.

@item --no-build-hook
Do not attempt to offload builds @i{via} the ``build hook'' of the daemon
(@pxref{Daemon Offload Setup}).  That is, always build things locally
instead of offloading builds to remote machines.

@item --max-silent-time=@var{seconds}
When the build or substitution process remains silent for more than
@var{seconds}, terminate it and report a build failure.

By default, the daemon's setting is honored (@pxref{Invoking
guix-daemon, @code{--max-silent-time}}).

@item --timeout=@var{seconds}
Likewise, when the build or substitution process lasts for more than
@var{seconds}, terminate it and report a build failure.

By default, the daemon's setting is honored (@pxref{Invoking
guix-daemon, @code{--timeout}}).

@c Note: This option is actually not part of %standard-build-options but
@c most programs honor it.
@cindex verbosity, of the command-line tools
@cindex build logs, verbosity
@item -v @var{level}
@itemx --verbosity=@var{level}
Use the given verbosity @var{level}, an integer.  Choosing 0 means that no
output is produced, 1 is for quiet output, and 2 shows all the build log
output on standard error.

@item --cores=@var{n}
@itemx -c @var{n}
Allow the use of up to @var{n} CPU cores for the build.  The special
value @code{0} means to use as many CPU cores as available.

@item --max-jobs=@var{n}
@itemx -M @var{n}
Allow at most @var{n} build jobs in parallel.  @xref{Invoking
guix-daemon, @code{--max-jobs}}, for details about this option and the
equivalent @command{guix-daemon} option.

@item --debug=@var{level}
Produce debugging output coming from the build daemon.  @var{level} must be an
integer between 0 and 5; higher means more verbose output.  Setting a level of
4 or more may be helpful when debugging setup issues with the build daemon.

@end table

Behind the scenes, @command{guix build} is essentially an interface to
the @code{package-derivation} procedure of the @code{(guix packages)}
module, and to the @code{build-derivations} procedure of the @code{(guix
derivations)} module.

In addition to options explicitly passed on the command line,
@command{guix build} and other @command{guix} commands that support
building honor the @code{GUIX_BUILD_OPTIONS} environment variable.

@defvr {Environment Variable} GUIX_BUILD_OPTIONS
Users can define this variable to a list of command line options that
will automatically be used by @command{guix build} and other
@command{guix} commands that can perform builds, as in the example
below:

@example
$ export GUIX_BUILD_OPTIONS="--no-substitutes -c 2 -L /foo/bar"
@end example

These options are parsed independently, and the result is appended to
the parsed command-line options.
@end defvr


@node Package Transformation Options
@subsection Package Transformation Options

@cindex package variants
Another set of command-line options supported by @command{guix build}
and also @command{guix package} are @dfn{package transformation
options}.  These are options that make it possible to define @dfn{package
variants}---for instance, packages built from different source code.
This is a convenient way to create customized packages on the fly
without having to type in the definitions of package variants
(@pxref{Defining Packages}).

@table @code

@item --with-source=@var{source}
@itemx --with-source=@var{package}=@var{source}
@itemx --with-source=@var{package}@@@var{version}=@var{source}
Use @var{source} as the source of @var{package}, and @var{version} as
its version number.
@var{source} must be a file name or a URL, as for @command{guix
download} (@pxref{Invoking guix download}).

When @var{package} is omitted,
it is taken to be the package name specified on the
command line that matches the base of @var{source}---e.g.,
if @var{source} is @code{/src/guile-2.0.10.tar.gz}, the corresponding
package is @code{guile}.

Likewise, when @var{version} is omitted, the version string is inferred from
@var{source}; in the previous example, it is @code{2.0.10}.

This option allows users to try out versions of packages other than the
one provided by the distribution.  The example below downloads
@file{ed-1.7.tar.gz} from a GNU mirror and uses that as the source for
the @code{ed} package:

@example
guix build ed --with-source=mirror://gnu/ed/ed-1.7.tar.gz
@end example

As a developer, @code{--with-source} makes it easy to test release
candidates:

@example
guix build guile --with-source=../guile-2.0.9.219-e1bb7.tar.xz
@end example

@dots{} or to build from a checkout in a pristine environment:

@example
$ git clone git://git.sv.gnu.org/guix.git
$ guix build guix --with-source=guix@@1.0=./guix
@end example

@item --with-input=@var{package}=@var{replacement}
Replace dependency on @var{package} by a dependency on
@var{replacement}.  @var{package} must be a package name, and
@var{replacement} must be a package specification such as @code{guile}
or @code{guile@@1.8}.

For instance, the following command builds Guix, but replaces its
dependency on the current stable version of Guile with a dependency on
the legacy version of Guile, @code{guile@@2.0}:

@example
guix build --with-input=guile=guile@@2.0 guix
@end example

This is a recursive, deep replacement.  So in this example, both
@code{guix} and its dependency @code{guile-json} (which also depends on
@code{guile}) get rebuilt against @code{guile@@2.0}.

This is implemented using the @code{package-input-rewriting} Scheme
procedure (@pxref{Defining Packages, @code{package-input-rewriting}}).

@item --with-graft=@var{package}=@var{replacement}
This is similar to @code{--with-input} but with an important difference:
instead of rebuilding the whole dependency chain, @var{replacement} is
built and then @dfn{grafted} onto the binaries that were initially
referring to @var{package}.  @xref{Security Updates}, for more
information on grafts.

For example, the command below grafts version 3.5.4 of GnuTLS onto Wget
and all its dependencies, replacing references to the version of GnuTLS
they currently refer to:

@example
guix build --with-graft=gnutls=gnutls@@3.5.4 wget
@end example

This has the advantage of being much faster than rebuilding everything.
But there is a caveat: it works if and only if @var{package} and
@var{replacement} are strictly compatible---for example, if they provide
a library, the application binary interface (ABI) of those libraries
must be compatible.  If @var{replacement} is somehow incompatible with
@var{package}, then the resulting package may be unusable.  Use with
care!

@item --with-git-url=@var{package}=@var{url}
@cindex Git, using the latest commit
@cindex latest commit, building
Build @var{package} from the latest commit of the @code{master} branch of the
Git repository at @var{url}.  Git sub-modules of the repository are fetched,
recursively.

For example, the following command builds the NumPy Python library against the
latest commit of the master branch of Python itself:

@example
guix build python-numpy \
  --with-git-url=python=https://github.com/python/cpython
@end example

This option can also be combined with @code{--with-branch} or
@code{--with-commit} (see below).

@cindex continuous integration
Obviously, since it uses the latest commit of the given branch, the result of
such a command varies over time.  Nevertheless it is a convenient way to
rebuild entire software stacks against the latest commit of one or more
packages.  This is particularly useful in the context of continuous
integration (CI).

Checkouts are kept in a cache under @file{~/.cache/guix/checkouts} to speed up
consecutive accesses to the same repository.  You may want to clean it up once
in a while to save disk space.

@item --with-branch=@var{package}=@var{branch}
Build @var{package} from the latest commit of @var{branch}.  If the
@code{source} field of @var{package} is an origin with the @code{git-fetch}
method (@pxref{origin Reference}) or a @code{git-checkout} object, the
repository URL is taken from that @code{source}.  Otherwise you have to use
@code{--with-git-url} to specify the URL of the Git repository.

For instance, the following command builds @code{guile-sqlite3} from the
latest commit of its @code{master} branch, and then builds @code{guix} (which
depends on it) and @code{cuirass} (which depends on @code{guix}) against this
specific @code{guile-sqlite3} build:

@example
guix build --with-branch=guile-sqlite3=master cuirass
@end example

@item --with-commit=@var{package}=@var{commit}
This is similar to @code{--with-branch}, except that it builds from
@var{commit} rather than the tip of a branch.  @var{commit} must be a valid
Git commit SHA1 identifier.
@end table

@node Additional Build Options
@subsection Additional Build Options

The command-line options presented below are specific to @command{guix
build}.

@table @code

@item --quiet
@itemx -q
Build quietly, without displaying the build log; this is equivalent to
@code{--verbosity=0}.  Upon completion, the build log is kept in @file{/var}
(or similar) and can always be retrieved using the @option{--log-file} option.

@item --file=@var{file}
@itemx -f @var{file}
Build the package, derivation, or other file-like object that the code within
@var{file} evaluates to (@pxref{G-Expressions, file-like objects}).

As an example, @var{file} might contain a package definition like this
(@pxref{Defining Packages}):

@example
@verbatiminclude package-hello.scm
@end example

@item --expression=@var{expr}
@itemx -e @var{expr}
Build the package or derivation @var{expr} evaluates to.

For example, @var{expr} may be @code{(@@ (gnu packages guile)
guile-1.8)}, which unambiguously designates this specific variant of
version 1.8 of Guile.

Alternatively, @var{expr} may be a G-expression, in which case it is used
as a build program passed to @code{gexp->derivation}
(@pxref{G-Expressions}).

Lastly, @var{expr} may refer to a zero-argument monadic procedure
(@pxref{The Store Monad}).  The procedure must return a derivation as a
monadic value, which is then passed through @code{run-with-store}.

@item --source
@itemx -S
Build the source derivations of the packages, rather than the packages
themselves.

For instance, @code{guix build -S gcc} returns something like
@file{/gnu/store/@dots{}-gcc-4.7.2.tar.bz2}, which is the GCC
source tarball.

The returned source tarball is the result of applying any patches and
code snippets specified in the package @code{origin} (@pxref{Defining
Packages}).

@item --sources
Fetch and return the source of @var{package-or-derivation} and all their
dependencies, recursively.  This is a handy way to obtain a local copy
of all the source code needed to build @var{packages}, allowing you to
eventually build them even without network access.  It is an extension
of the @code{--source} option and can accept one of the following
optional argument values:

@table @code
@item package
This value causes the @code{--sources} option to behave in the same way
as the @code{--source} option.

@item all
Build the source derivations of all packages, including any source that
might be listed as @code{inputs}.  This is the default value.

@example
$ guix build --sources tzdata
The following derivations will be built:
   /gnu/store/@dots{}-tzdata2015b.tar.gz.drv
   /gnu/store/@dots{}-tzcode2015b.tar.gz.drv
@end example

@item transitive
Build the source derivations of all packages, as well of all transitive
inputs to the packages.  This can be used e.g.@: to
prefetch package source for later offline building.

@example
$ guix build --sources=transitive tzdata
The following derivations will be built:
   /gnu/store/@dots{}-tzcode2015b.tar.gz.drv
   /gnu/store/@dots{}-findutils-4.4.2.tar.xz.drv
   /gnu/store/@dots{}-grep-2.21.tar.xz.drv
   /gnu/store/@dots{}-coreutils-8.23.tar.xz.drv
   /gnu/store/@dots{}-make-4.1.tar.xz.drv
   /gnu/store/@dots{}-bash-4.3.tar.xz.drv
@dots{}
@end example

@end table

@item --system=@var{system}
@itemx -s @var{system}
Attempt to build for @var{system}---e.g., @code{i686-linux}---instead of
the system type of the build host.

@quotation Note
The @code{--system} flag is for @emph{native} compilation and must not
be confused with cross-compilation.  See @code{--target} below for
information on cross-compilation.
@end quotation

An example use of this is on Linux-based systems, which can emulate
different personalities.  For instance, passing
@code{--system=i686-linux} on an @code{x86_64-linux} system or
@code{--system=armhf-linux} on an @code{aarch64-linux} system allows you
to build packages in a complete 32-bit environment.

@quotation Note
Building for an @code{armhf-linux} system is unconditionally enabled on
@code{aarch64-linux} machines, although certain aarch64 chipsets do not
allow for this functionality, notably the ThunderX.
@end quotation

Similarly, when transparent emulation with QEMU and @code{binfmt_misc}
is enabled (@pxref{Virtualization Services,
@code{qemu-binfmt-service-type}}), you can build for any system for
which a QEMU @code{binfmt_misc} handler is installed.

Builds for a system other than that of the machine you are using can
also be offloaded to a remote machine of the right architecture.
@xref{Daemon Offload Setup}, for more information on offloading.

@item --target=@var{triplet}
@cindex cross-compilation
Cross-build for @var{triplet}, which must be a valid GNU triplet, such
as @code{"mips64el-linux-gnu"} (@pxref{Specifying target triplets, GNU
configuration triplets,, autoconf, Autoconf}).

@anchor{build-check}
@item --check
@cindex determinism, checking
@cindex reproducibility, checking
Rebuild @var{package-or-derivation}, which are already available in the
store, and raise an error if the build results are not bit-for-bit
identical.

This mechanism allows you to check whether previously installed
substitutes are genuine (@pxref{Substitutes}), or whether the build result
of a package is deterministic.  @xref{Invoking guix challenge}, for more
background information and tools.

When used in conjunction with @option{--keep-failed}, the differing
output is kept in the store, under @file{/gnu/store/@dots{}-check}.
This makes it easy to look for differences between the two results.

@item --repair
@cindex repairing store items
@cindex corruption, recovering from
Attempt to repair the specified store items, if they are corrupt, by
re-downloading or rebuilding them.

This operation is not atomic and thus restricted to @code{root}.

@item --derivations
@itemx -d
Return the derivation paths, not the output paths, of the given
packages.

@item --root=@var{file}
@itemx -r @var{file}
@cindex GC roots, adding
@cindex garbage collector roots, adding
Make @var{file} a symlink to the result, and register it as a garbage
collector root.

Consequently, the results of this @command{guix build} invocation are
protected from garbage collection until @var{file} is removed.  When
that option is omitted, build results are eligible for garbage
collection as soon as the build completes.  @xref{Invoking guix gc}, for
more on GC roots.

@item --log-file
@cindex build logs, access
Return the build log file names or URLs for the given
@var{package-or-derivation}, or raise an error if build logs are
missing.

This works regardless of how packages or derivations are specified.  For
instance, the following invocations are equivalent:

@example
guix build --log-file `guix build -d guile`
guix build --log-file `guix build guile`
guix build --log-file guile
guix build --log-file -e '(@@ (gnu packages guile) guile-2.0)'
@end example

If a log is unavailable locally, and unless @code{--no-substitutes} is
passed, the command looks for a corresponding log on one of the
substitute servers (as specified with @code{--substitute-urls}.)

So for instance, imagine you want to see the build log of GDB on MIPS,
but you are actually on an @code{x86_64} machine:

@example
$ guix build --log-file gdb -s mips64el-linux
https://@value{SUBSTITUTE-SERVER}/log/@dots{}-gdb-7.10
@end example

You can freely access a huge library of build logs!
@end table

@node Debugging Build Failures
@subsection Debugging Build Failures

@cindex build failures, debugging
When defining a new package (@pxref{Defining Packages}), you will
probably find yourself spending some time debugging and tweaking the
build until it succeeds.  To do that, you need to operate the build
commands yourself in an environment as close as possible to the one the
build daemon uses.

To that end, the first thing to do is to use the @option{--keep-failed}
or @option{-K} option of @command{guix build}, which will keep the
failed build tree in @file{/tmp} or whatever directory you specified as
@code{TMPDIR} (@pxref{Invoking guix build, @code{--keep-failed}}).

From there on, you can @command{cd} to the failed build tree and source
the @file{environment-variables} file, which contains all the
environment variable definitions that were in place when the build
failed.  So let's say you're debugging a build failure in package
@code{foo}; a typical session would look like this:

@example
$ guix build foo -K
@dots{} @i{build fails}
$ cd /tmp/guix-build-foo.drv-0
$ source ./environment-variables
$ cd foo-1.2
@end example

Now, you can invoke commands as if you were the daemon (almost) and
troubleshoot your build process.

Sometimes it happens that, for example, a package's tests pass when you
run them manually but they fail when the daemon runs them.  This can
happen because the daemon runs builds in containers where, unlike in our
environment above, network access is missing, @file{/bin/sh} does not
exist, etc. (@pxref{Build Environment Setup}).

In such cases, you may need to run inspect the build process from within
a container similar to the one the build daemon creates:

@example
$ guix build -K foo
@dots{}
$ cd /tmp/guix-build-foo.drv-0
$ guix environment --no-grafts -C foo --ad-hoc strace gdb
[env]# source ./environment-variables
[env]# cd foo-1.2
@end example

Here, @command{guix environment -C} creates a container and spawns a new
shell in it (@pxref{Invoking guix environment}).  The @command{--ad-hoc
strace gdb} part adds the @command{strace} and @command{gdb} commands to
the container, which would may find handy while debugging.  The
@option{--no-grafts} option makes sure we get the exact same
environment, with ungrafted packages (@pxref{Security Updates}, for more
info on grafts).

To get closer to a container like that used by the build daemon, we can
remove @file{/bin/sh}:

@example
[env]# rm /bin/sh
@end example

(Don't worry, this is harmless: this is all happening in the throw-away
container created by @command{guix environment}.)

The @command{strace} command is probably not in the search path, but we
can run:

@example
[env]# $GUIX_ENVIRONMENT/bin/strace -f -o log make check
@end example

In this way, not only you will have reproduced the environment variables
the daemon uses, you will also be running the build process in a container
similar to the one the daemon uses.

@node Invoking guix download
@section Invoking @command{guix download}

@cindex @command{guix download}
@cindex downloading package sources
When writing a package definition, developers typically need to download
a source tarball, compute its SHA256 hash, and write that
hash in the package definition (@pxref{Defining Packages}).  The
@command{guix download} tool helps with this task: it downloads a file
from the given URI, adds it to the store, and prints both its file name
in the store and its SHA256 hash.

The fact that the downloaded file is added to the store saves bandwidth:
when the developer eventually tries to build the newly defined package
with @command{guix build}, the source tarball will not have to be
downloaded again because it is already in the store.  It is also a
convenient way to temporarily stash files, which may be deleted
eventually (@pxref{Invoking guix gc}).

The @command{guix download} command supports the same URIs as used in
package definitions.  In particular, it supports @code{mirror://} URIs.
@code{https} URIs (HTTP over TLS) are supported @emph{provided} the
Guile bindings for GnuTLS are available in the user's environment; when
they are not available, an error is raised.  @xref{Guile Preparations,
how to install the GnuTLS bindings for Guile,, gnutls-guile,
GnuTLS-Guile}, for more information.

@command{guix download} verifies HTTPS server certificates by loading
the certificates of X.509 authorities from the directory pointed to by
the @code{SSL_CERT_DIR} environment variable (@pxref{X.509
Certificates}), unless @option{--no-check-certificate} is used.

The following options are available:

@table @code
@item --format=@var{fmt}
@itemx -f @var{fmt}
Write the hash in the format specified by @var{fmt}.  For more
information on the valid values for @var{fmt}, @pxref{Invoking guix hash}.

@item --no-check-certificate
Do not validate the X.509 certificates of HTTPS servers.

When using this option, you have @emph{absolutely no guarantee} that you
are communicating with the authentic server responsible for the given
URL, which makes you vulnerable to ``man-in-the-middle'' attacks.

@item --output=@var{file}
@itemx -o @var{file}
Save the downloaded file to @var{file} instead of adding it to the
store.

@node Invoking guix hash
@section Invoking @command{guix hash}

@cindex @command{guix hash}
The @command{guix hash} command computes the SHA256 hash of a file.
It is primarily a convenience tool for anyone contributing to the
distribution: it computes the cryptographic hash of a file, which can be
used in the definition of a package (@pxref{Defining Packages}).

The general syntax is:

@example
guix hash @var{option} @var{file}
@end example

When @var{file} is @code{-} (a hyphen), @command{guix hash} computes the
hash of data read from standard input.  @command{guix hash} has the
following options:

@table @code

@item --format=@var{fmt}
@itemx -f @var{fmt}
Write the hash in the format specified by @var{fmt}.

Supported formats: @code{nix-base32}, @code{base32}, @code{base16}
(@code{hex} and @code{hexadecimal} can be used as well).

If the @option{--format} option is not specified, @command{guix hash}
will output the hash in @code{nix-base32}.  This representation is used
in the definitions of packages.

@item --recursive
@itemx -r
Compute the hash on @var{file} recursively.

In this case, the hash is computed on an archive containing @var{file},
including its children if it is a directory.  Some of the metadata of
@var{file} is part of the archive; for instance, when @var{file} is a
regular file, the hash is different depending on whether @var{file} is
executable or not.  Metadata such as time stamps has no impact on the
hash (@pxref{Invoking guix archive}).
@c FIXME: Replace xref above with xref to an ``Archive'' section when
@c it exists.

@item --exclude-vcs
@itemx -x
When combined with @option{--recursive}, exclude version control system
directories (@file{.bzr}, @file{.git}, @file{.hg}, etc.)

@vindex git-fetch
As an example, here is how you would compute the hash of a Git checkout,
which is useful when using the @code{git-fetch} method (@pxref{origin
Reference}):

@example
$ git clone http://example.org/foo.git
$ cd foo
$ guix hash -rx .

@cindex Invoking @command{guix import}
The @command{guix import} command is useful for people who would like to
add a package to the distribution with as little work as
possible---a legitimate demand.  The command knows of a few
repositories from which it can ``import'' package metadata.  The result
is a package definition, or a template thereof, in the format we know
(@pxref{Defining Packages}).

The general syntax is:

@example
guix import @var{importer} @var{options}@dots{}
@end example

@var{importer} specifies the source from which to import package
metadata, and @var{options} specifies a package identifier and other
options specific to @var{importer}.  Currently, the available
``importers'' are:

@table @code
@item gnu
Import metadata for the given GNU package.  This provides a template
for the latest version of that GNU package, including the hash of its
source tarball, and its canonical synopsis and description.

Additional information such as the package dependencies and its
license needs to be figured out manually.

For example, the following command returns a package definition for
GNU@tie{}Hello:

@example
guix import gnu hello
@end example

Specific command-line options are:

@table @code
@item --key-download=@var{policy}
As for @code{guix refresh}, specify the policy to handle missing OpenPGP
keys when verifying the package signature.  @xref{Invoking guix
refresh, @code{--key-download}}.
@end table

@item pypi
@cindex pypi
Import metadata from the @uref{https://pypi.python.org/, Python Package
Index}.  Information is taken from the JSON-formatted description
available at @code{pypi.python.org} and usually includes all the relevant
information, including package dependencies.  For maximum efficiency, it
is recommended to install the @command{unzip} utility, so that the
importer can unzip Python wheels and gather data from them.

The command below imports metadata for the @code{itsdangerous} Python
package:

@example
guix import pypi itsdangerous
@end example

@table @code
@item --recursive
@itemx -r
Traverse the dependency graph of the given upstream package recursively
and generate package expressions for all those packages that are not yet
in Guix.
@end table

@item gem
@cindex gem
Import metadata from @uref{https://rubygems.org/, RubyGems}.  Information
is taken from the JSON-formatted description available at
@code{rubygems.org} and includes most relevant information, including
runtime dependencies.  There are some caveats, however.  The metadata
doesn't distinguish between synopses and descriptions, so the same string
is used for both fields.  Additionally, the details of non-Ruby
dependencies required to build native extensions is unavailable and left
as an exercise to the packager.

The command below imports metadata for the @code{rails} Ruby package:

@example
guix import gem rails
@end example

@table @code
@item --recursive
@itemx -r
Traverse the dependency graph of the given upstream package recursively
and generate package expressions for all those packages that are not yet
in Guix.
@end table

@item cpan
@cindex CPAN
Import metadata from @uref{https://www.metacpan.org/, MetaCPAN}.
Information is taken from the JSON-formatted metadata provided through
@uref{https://fastapi.metacpan.org/, MetaCPAN's API} and includes most
relevant information, such as module dependencies.  License information
should be checked closely.  If Perl is available in the store, then the
@code{corelist} utility will be used to filter core modules out of the
list of dependencies.

The command command below imports metadata for the @code{Acme::Boolean}
Perl module:

@example
guix import cpan Acme::Boolean
@end example

@item cran
@cindex CRAN
@cindex Bioconductor
Import metadata from @uref{https://cran.r-project.org/, CRAN}, the
central repository for the @uref{http://r-project.org, GNU@tie{}R
statistical and graphical environment}.

Information is extracted from the @code{DESCRIPTION} file of the package.

The command command below imports metadata for the @code{Cairo}
R package:

@example
guix import cran Cairo
@end example

When @code{--recursive} is added, the importer will traverse the
dependency graph of the given upstream package recursively and generate
package expressions for all those packages that are not yet in Guix.

When @code{--archive=bioconductor} is added, metadata is imported from
@uref{https://www.bioconductor.org/, Bioconductor}, a repository of R
packages for for the analysis and comprehension of high-throughput
genomic data in bioinformatics.

Information is extracted from the @code{DESCRIPTION} file of a package
published on the web interface of the Bioconductor SVN repository.

The command below imports metadata for the @code{GenomicRanges}
R package:

@example
guix import cran --archive=bioconductor GenomicRanges
@end example

@item texlive
@cindex TeX Live
@cindex CTAN
Import metadata from @uref{http://www.ctan.org/, CTAN}, the
comprehensive TeX archive network for TeX packages that are part of the
@uref{https://www.tug.org/texlive/, TeX Live distribution}.

Information about the package is obtained through the XML API provided
by CTAN, while the source code is downloaded from the SVN repository of
the Tex Live project.  This is done because the CTAN does not keep
versioned archives.

The command command below imports metadata for the @code{fontspec}
TeX package:

@example
guix import texlive fontspec
@end example

When @code{--archive=DIRECTORY} is added, the source code is downloaded
not from the @file{latex} sub-directory of the @file{texmf-dist/source}
tree in the TeX Live SVN repository, but from the specified sibling
directory under the same root.

The command below imports metadata for the @code{ifxetex} package from
CTAN while fetching the sources from the directory
@file{texmf/source/generic}:

@example
guix import texlive --archive=generic ifxetex
@end example

@item json
@cindex JSON, import
Import package metadata from a local JSON file.  Consider the following
example package definition in JSON format:

@example
@{
  "name": "hello",
  "version": "2.10",
  "source": "mirror://gnu/hello/hello-2.10.tar.gz",
  "build-system": "gnu",
  "home-page": "https://www.gnu.org/software/hello/",
  "synopsis": "Hello, GNU world: An example GNU package",
  "description": "GNU Hello prints a greeting.",
  "license": "GPL-3.0+",
  "native-inputs": ["gcc@@6"]
@}
@end example

The field names are the same as for the @code{<package>} record
(@xref{Defining Packages}).  References to other packages are provided
as JSON lists of quoted package specification strings such as
@code{guile} or @code{guile@@2.0}.

The importer also supports a more explicit source definition using the
common fields for @code{<origin>} records:

@example
@{
  @dots{}
  "source": @{
    "method": "url-fetch",
    "uri": "mirror://gnu/hello/hello-2.10.tar.gz",
    "sha256": @{
      "base32": "0ssi1wpaf7plaswqqjwigppsg5fyh99vdlb9kzl7c9lng89ndq1i"
    @}
  @}
  @dots{}
@}
@end example

The command below reads metadata from the JSON file @code{hello.json}
and outputs a package expression:

@example
guix import json hello.json
@end example

@item nix
Import metadata from a local copy of the source of the
@uref{http://nixos.org/nixpkgs/, Nixpkgs distribution}@footnote{This
relies on the @command{nix-instantiate} command of
@uref{http://nixos.org/nix/, Nix}.}.  Package definitions in Nixpkgs are
typically written in a mixture of Nix-language and Bash code.  This
command only imports the high-level package structure that is written in
the Nix language.  It normally includes all the basic fields of a
package definition.

When importing a GNU package, the synopsis and descriptions are replaced
by their canonical upstream variant.

Usually, you will first need to do:

@example
export NIX_REMOTE=daemon
@end example

@noindent
so that @command{nix-instantiate} does not try to open the Nix database.

As an example, the command below imports the package definition of
LibreOffice (more precisely, it imports the definition of the package
bound to the @code{libreoffice} top-level attribute):

@example
guix import nix ~/path/to/nixpkgs libreoffice
@end example

@item hackage
@cindex hackage
Import metadata from the Haskell community's central package archive
@uref{https://hackage.haskell.org/, Hackage}.  Information is taken from
Cabal files and includes all the relevant information, including package
dependencies.

Specific command-line options are:

@table @code
@item --stdin
@itemx -s
Read a Cabal file from standard input.
@item --no-test-dependencies
@itemx -t
Do not include dependencies required only by the test suites.
@item --cabal-environment=@var{alist}
@itemx -e @var{alist}
@var{alist} is a Scheme alist defining the environment in which the
Cabal conditionals are evaluated.  The accepted keys are: @code{os},
@code{arch}, @code{impl} and a string representing the name of a flag.
The value associated with a flag has to be either the symbol
@code{true} or @code{false}.  The value associated with other keys
has to conform to the Cabal file format definition.  The default value
associated with the keys @code{os}, @code{arch} and @code{impl} is
@samp{linux}, @samp{x86_64} and @samp{ghc}, respectively.
@item --recursive
@itemx -r
Traverse the dependency graph of the given upstream package recursively
and generate package expressions for all those packages that are not yet
in Guix.
@end table

The command below imports metadata for the latest version of the
@code{HTTP} Haskell package without including test dependencies and
specifying the value of the flag @samp{network-uri} as @code{false}:

@example
guix import hackage -t -e "'((\"network-uri\" . false))" HTTP
@end example

A specific package version may optionally be specified by following the
package name by an at-sign and a version number as in the following example:

@example
guix import hackage mtl@@2.1.3.1
@end example

@item stackage
@cindex stackage
The @code{stackage} importer is a wrapper around the @code{hackage} one.
It takes a package name, looks up the package version included in a
long-term support (LTS) @uref{https://www.stackage.org, Stackage}
release and uses the @code{hackage} importer to retrieve its metadata.
Note that it is up to you to select an LTS release compatible with the
GHC compiler used by Guix.

Specific command-line options are:

@table @code
@item --no-test-dependencies
@itemx -t
Do not include dependencies required only by the test suites.
@item --lts-version=@var{version}
@itemx -l @var{version}
@var{version} is the desired LTS release version.  If omitted the latest
release is used.
@item --recursive
@itemx -r
Traverse the dependency graph of the given upstream package recursively
and generate package expressions for all those packages that are not yet
in Guix.
@end table

The command below imports metadata for the @code{HTTP} Haskell package
included in the LTS Stackage release version 7.18:

@example
guix import stackage --lts-version=7.18 HTTP
@end example

@item elpa
@cindex elpa
Import metadata from an Emacs Lisp Package Archive (ELPA) package
repository (@pxref{Packages,,, emacs, The GNU Emacs Manual}).

Specific command-line options are:

@table @code
@item --archive=@var{repo}
@itemx -a @var{repo}
@var{repo} identifies the archive repository from which to retrieve the
information.  Currently the supported repositories and their identifiers
are:
@itemize -
@item
@uref{http://elpa.gnu.org/packages, GNU}, selected by the @code{gnu}
identifier.  This is the default.

Packages from @code{elpa.gnu.org} are signed with one of the keys
contained in the GnuPG keyring at
@file{share/emacs/25.1/etc/package-keyring.gpg} (or similar) in the
@code{emacs} package (@pxref{Package Installation, ELPA package
signatures,, emacs, The GNU Emacs Manual}).

@item
@uref{http://stable.melpa.org/packages, MELPA-Stable}, selected by the
@code{melpa-stable} identifier.

@item
@uref{http://melpa.org/packages, MELPA}, selected by the @code{melpa}
identifier.
@end itemize

@item --recursive
@itemx -r
Traverse the dependency graph of the given upstream package recursively
and generate package expressions for all those packages that are not yet
in Guix.
@end table

@item crate
@cindex crate
Import metadata from the crates.io Rust package repository
@uref{https://crates.io, crates.io}.

@item opam
@cindex OPAM
@cindex OCaml
Import metadata from the @uref{https://opam.ocaml.org/, OPAM} package
repository used by the OCaml community.
@end table

The structure of the @command{guix import} code is modular.  It would be
useful to have more importers for other package formats, and your help
is welcome here (@pxref{Contributing}).

@node Invoking guix refresh
@section Invoking @command{guix refresh}

@cindex @command {guix refresh}
The primary audience of the @command{guix refresh} command is developers
of the GNU software distribution.  By default, it reports any packages
provided by the distribution that are outdated compared to the latest
upstream version, like this:

@example
$ guix refresh
gnu/packages/gettext.scm:29:13: gettext would be upgraded from 0.18.1.1 to 0.18.2.1
gnu/packages/glib.scm:77:12: glib would be upgraded from 2.34.3 to 2.37.0
@end example

Alternately, one can specify packages to consider, in which case a
warning is emitted for packages that lack an updater:

@example
$ guix refresh coreutils guile guile-ssh
gnu/packages/ssh.scm:205:2: warning: no updater for guile-ssh
gnu/packages/guile.scm:136:12: guile would be upgraded from 2.0.12 to 2.0.13
@end example

@command{guix refresh} browses the upstream repository of each package and determines
the highest version number of the releases therein.  The command
knows how to update specific types of packages: GNU packages, ELPA
packages, etc.---see the documentation for @option{--type} below.  There
are many packages, though, for which it lacks a method to determine
whether a new upstream release is available.  However, the mechanism is
extensible, so feel free to get in touch with us to add a new method!

@table @code

@item --recursive
Consider the packages specified, and all the packages upon which they depend.

@example
$ guix refresh --recursive coreutils
gnu/packages/acl.scm:35:2: warning: no updater for acl
gnu/packages/m4.scm:30:12: info: 1.4.18 is already the latest version of m4
gnu/packages/xml.scm:68:2: warning: no updater for expat
gnu/packages/multiprecision.scm:40:12: info: 6.1.2 is already the latest version of gmp
@dots{}
@end example

@end table

Sometimes the upstream name differs from the package name used in Guix,
and @command{guix refresh} needs a little help.  Most updaters honor the
@code{upstream-name} property in package definitions, which can be used
to that effect:

@example
(define-public network-manager
  (package
    (name "network-manager")
    ;; @dots{}
    (properties '((upstream-name . "NetworkManager")))))
@end example

When passed @code{--update}, it modifies distribution source files to
update the version numbers and source tarball hashes of those package
recipes (@pxref{Defining Packages}).  This is achieved by downloading
each package's latest source tarball and its associated OpenPGP
signature, authenticating the downloaded tarball against its signature
using @command{gpg}, and finally computing its hash.  When the public
key used to sign the tarball is missing from the user's keyring, an
attempt is made to automatically retrieve it from a public key server;
when this is successful, the key is added to the user's keyring; otherwise,
@command{guix refresh} reports an error.

The following options are supported:

@table @code

@item --expression=@var{expr}
@itemx -e @var{expr}
Consider the package @var{expr} evaluates to.

This is useful to precisely refer to a package, as in this example:

@example
guix refresh -l -e '(@@@@ (gnu packages commencement) glibc-final)'
@end example

This command lists the dependents of the ``final'' libc (essentially all
the packages.)

@item --update
@itemx -u
Update distribution source files (package recipes) in place.  This is
usually run from a checkout of the Guix source tree (@pxref{Running
Guix Before It Is Installed}):

@example
$ ./pre-inst-env guix refresh -s non-core -u
@end example

@xref{Defining Packages}, for more information on package definitions.

@item --select=[@var{subset}]
@itemx -s @var{subset}
Select all the packages in @var{subset}, one of @code{core} or
@code{non-core}.

The @code{core} subset refers to all the packages at the core of the
distribution---i.e., packages that are used to build ``everything
else''.  This includes GCC, libc, Binutils, Bash, etc.  Usually,
changing one of these packages in the distribution entails a rebuild of
all the others.  Thus, such updates are an inconvenience to users in
terms of build time or bandwidth used to achieve the upgrade.

The @code{non-core} subset refers to the remaining packages.  It is
typically useful in cases where an update of the core packages would be
inconvenient.

@item --manifest=@var{file}
@itemx -m @var{file}
Select all the packages from the manifest in @var{file}. This is useful to
check if any packages of the user manifest can be updated.

@item --type=@var{updater}
@itemx -t @var{updater}
Select only packages handled by @var{updater} (may be a comma-separated
list of updaters).  Currently, @var{updater} may be one of:

@table @code
@item gnu
the updater for GNU packages;
@item gnome
the updater for GNOME packages;
@item kde
the updater for KDE packages;
@item xorg
the updater for X.org packages;
@item kernel.org
the updater for packages hosted on kernel.org;
@item elpa
the updater for @uref{http://elpa.gnu.org/, ELPA} packages;
@item cran
the updater for @uref{https://cran.r-project.org/, CRAN} packages;
@item bioconductor
the updater for @uref{https://www.bioconductor.org/, Bioconductor} R packages;
@item cpan
the updater for @uref{http://www.cpan.org/, CPAN} packages;
@item pypi
the updater for @uref{https://pypi.python.org, PyPI} packages.
@item gem
the updater for @uref{https://rubygems.org, RubyGems} packages.
@item github
the updater for @uref{https://github.com, GitHub} packages.
@item hackage
the updater for @uref{https://hackage.haskell.org, Hackage} packages.
@item stackage
the updater for @uref{https://www.stackage.org, Stackage} packages.
@item crate
the updater for @uref{https://crates.io, Crates} packages.
@item launchpad
the updater for @uref{https://launchpad.net, Launchpad} packages.
@end table

For instance, the following command only checks for updates of Emacs
packages hosted at @code{elpa.gnu.org} and for updates of CRAN packages:

@example
$ guix refresh --type=elpa,cran
gnu/packages/statistics.scm:819:13: r-testthat would be upgraded from 0.10.0 to 0.11.0
gnu/packages/emacs.scm:856:13: emacs-auctex would be upgraded from 11.88.6 to 11.88.9
@end example

@end table

In addition, @command{guix refresh} can be passed one or more package
names, as in this example:

@example
$ ./pre-inst-env guix refresh -u emacs idutils gcc@@4.8
@end example

@noindent
The command above specifically updates the @code{emacs} and
@code{idutils} packages.  The @code{--select} option would have no
effect in this case.

When considering whether to upgrade a package, it is sometimes
convenient to know which packages would be affected by the upgrade and
should be checked for compatibility.  For this the following option may
be used when passing @command{guix refresh} one or more package names:

@table @code

@item --list-updaters
@itemx -L
List available updaters and exit (see @option{--type} above.)

For each updater, display the fraction of packages it covers; at the
end, display the fraction of packages covered by all these updaters.

@item --list-dependent
@itemx -l
List top-level dependent packages that would need to be rebuilt as a
result of upgrading one or more packages.

@xref{Invoking guix graph, the @code{reverse-package} type of
@command{guix graph}}, for information on how to visualize the list of
dependents of a package.

@end table

Be aware that the @code{--list-dependent} option only
@emph{approximates} the rebuilds that would be required as a result of
an upgrade.  More rebuilds might be required under some circumstances.

@example
$ guix refresh --list-dependent flex
Building the following 120 packages would ensure 213 dependent packages are rebuilt:
hop@@2.4.0 geiser@@0.4 notmuch@@0.18 mu@@0.9.9.5 cflow@@1.4 idutils@@4.6 @dots{}
@end example

The command above lists a set of packages that could be built to check
for compatibility with an upgraded @code{flex} package.

@table @code

@item --list-transitive
List all the packages which one or more packages depend upon.

@example
$ guix refresh --list-transitive flex
flex@@2.6.4 depends on the following 25 packages: perl@@5.28.0 help2man@@1.47.6
bison@@3.0.5 indent@@2.2.10 tar@@1.30 gzip@@1.9 bzip2@@1.0.6 xz@@5.2.4 file@@5.33 @dots{}
@end example

@end table

The command above lists a set of packages which, when changed, would cause
@code{flex} to be rebuilt.

The following options can be used to customize GnuPG operation:

@table @code

@item --gpg=@var{command}
Use @var{command} as the GnuPG 2.x command.  @var{command} is searched
for in @code{$PATH}.

@item --keyring=@var{file}
Use @var{file} as the keyring for upstream keys.  @var{file} must be in the
@dfn{keybox format}.  Keybox files usually have a name ending in @file{.kbx}
and the GNU@tie{}Privacy Guard (GPG) can manipulate these files
(@pxref{kbxutil, @command{kbxutil},, gnupg, Using the GNU Privacy Guard}, for
information on a tool to manipulate keybox files).

When this option is omitted, @command{guix refresh} uses
@file{~/.config/guix/upstream/trustedkeys.kbx} as the keyring for upstream
signing keys.  OpenPGP signatures are checked against keys from this keyring;
missing keys are downloaded to this keyring as well (see
@option{--key-download} below.)

You can export keys from your default GPG keyring into a keybox file using
commands like this one:

@example
gpg --export rms@@gnu.org | kbxutil --import-openpgp >> mykeyring.kbx
@end example

Likewise, you can fetch keys to a specific keybox file like this:

@example

The @code{github} updater uses the
@uref{https://developer.github.com/v3/, GitHub API} to query for new
releases.  When used repeatedly e.g.@: when refreshing all packages,
GitHub will eventually refuse to answer any further API requests.  By
default 60 API requests per hour are allowed, and a full refresh on all
GitHub packages in Guix requires more than this.  Authentication with
GitHub through the use of an API token alleviates these limits.  To use
an API token, set the environment variable @code{GUIX_GITHUB_TOKEN} to a
token procured from @uref{https://github.com/settings/tokens} or
otherwise.

@section Invoking @command{guix lint}

@cindex @command{guix lint}
@cindex package, checking for errors
The @command{guix lint} command is meant to help package developers avoid
common errors and use a consistent style.  It runs a number of checks on
a given set of packages in order to find common mistakes in their
definitions.  Available @dfn{checkers} include (see
@code{--list-checkers} for a complete list):

@table @code
@item synopsis
@itemx description
Validate certain typographical and stylistic rules about package
descriptions and synopses.

@item inputs-should-be-native
Identify inputs that should most likely be native inputs.

@item source
@itemx home-page
@itemx mirror-url
@itemx github-url
@itemx source-file-name
Probe @code{home-page} and @code{source} URLs and report those that are
invalid.  Suggest a @code{mirror://} URL when applicable.  If the
@code{source} URL redirects to a GitHub URL, recommend usage of the GitHub
URL.  Check that the source file name is meaningful, e.g.@: is not just a
version number or ``git-checkout'', without a declared @code{file-name}
(@pxref{origin Reference}).

@item source-unstable-tarball
Parse the @code{source} URL to determine if a tarball from GitHub is
autogenerated or if it is a release tarball.  Unfortunately GitHub's
autogenerated tarballs are sometimes regenerated.

@item cve
@cindex security vulnerabilities
@cindex CVE, Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
Report known vulnerabilities found in the Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures (CVE) databases of the current and past year
@uref{https://nvd.nist.gov/download.cfm#CVE_FEED, published by the US
NIST}.

To view information about a particular vulnerability, visit pages such as:

@itemize
@item
@indicateurl{https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-YYYY-ABCD}
@item
@indicateurl{https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-YYYY-ABCD}
@end itemize

@noindent
where @code{CVE-YYYY-ABCD} is the CVE identifier---e.g.,
@code{CVE-2015-7554}.

Package developers can specify in package recipes the
@uref{https://nvd.nist.gov/cpe.cfm,Common Platform Enumeration (CPE)}
name and version of the package when they differ from the name or version
that Guix uses, as in this example:

@example
(package
  (name "grub")
  ;; @dots{}
  ;; CPE calls this package "grub2".
  (properties '((cpe-name . "grub2")
                (cpe-version . "2.3")))
@end example

@c See <http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/03/15/3>.
Some entries in the CVE database do not specify which version of a
package they apply to, and would thus ``stick around'' forever.  Package
developers who found CVE alerts and verified they can be ignored can
declare them as in this example:

@example
(package
  (name "t1lib")
  ;; @dots{}
  ;; These CVEs no longer apply and can be safely ignored.
  (properties `((lint-hidden-cve . ("CVE-2011-0433"

                                    "CVE-2011-5244")))))
@end example

@item formatting
Warn about obvious source code formatting issues: trailing white space,
use of tabulations, etc.
@end table

The general syntax is:

@example
guix lint @var{options} @var{package}@dots{}

@node Invoking guix size
@section Invoking @command{guix size}

@cindex size
@cindex package size
@cindex closure
@cindex @command{guix size}
The @command{guix size} command helps package developers profile the
disk usage of packages.  It is easy to overlook the impact of an
additional dependency added to a package, or the impact of using a
single output for a package that could easily be split (@pxref{Packages
with Multiple Outputs}).  Such are the typical issues that
@command{guix size} can highlight.

The command can be passed one or more package specifications
such as @code{gcc@@4.8}
or @code{guile:debug}, or a file name in the store.  Consider this
example:

@example
$ guix size coreutils
store item                               total    self
/gnu/store/@dots{}-gcc-5.5.0-lib           60.4    30.1  38.1%
/gnu/store/@dots{}-glibc-2.27              30.3    28.8  36.6%
/gnu/store/@dots{}-coreutils-8.28          78.9    15.0  19.0%
/gnu/store/@dots{}-gmp-6.1.2               63.1     2.7   3.4%
/gnu/store/@dots{}-bash-static-4.4.12       1.5     1.5   1.9%
/gnu/store/@dots{}-acl-2.2.52              61.1     0.4   0.5%
/gnu/store/@dots{}-attr-2.4.47             60.6     0.2   0.3%
/gnu/store/@dots{}-libcap-2.25             60.5     0.2   0.2%
total: 78.9 MiB
@end example

@cindex closure
The store items listed here constitute the @dfn{transitive closure} of
Coreutils---i.e., Coreutils and all its dependencies, recursively---as
would be returned by:

@example
$ guix gc -R /gnu/store/@dots{}-coreutils-8.23
@end example

Here the output shows three columns next to store items.  The first column,
labeled ``total'', shows the size in mebibytes (MiB) of the closure of
the store item---that is, its own size plus the size of all its
dependencies.  The next column, labeled ``self'', shows the size of the
item itself.  The last column shows the ratio of the size of the item
itself to the space occupied by all the items listed here.

In this example, we see that the closure of Coreutils weighs in at
79@tie{}MiB, most of which is taken by libc and GCC's run-time support
libraries.  (That libc and GCC's libraries represent a large fraction of
the closure is not a problem @i{per se} because they are always available
on the system anyway.)

When the package(s) passed to @command{guix size} are available in the
store@footnote{More precisely, @command{guix size} looks for the
@emph{ungrafted} variant of the given package(s), as returned by
@code{guix build @var{package} --no-grafts}.  @xref{Security Updates},
for information on grafts.}, @command{guix size} queries the daemon to determine its
dependencies, and measures its size in the store, similar to @command{du
-ms --apparent-size} (@pxref{du invocation,,, coreutils, GNU
Coreutils}).

When the given packages are @emph{not} in the store, @command{guix size}
reports information based on the available substitutes
(@pxref{Substitutes}).  This makes it possible it to profile disk usage of
store items that are not even on disk, only available remotely.

You can also specify several package names:

@example
$ guix size coreutils grep sed bash
store item                               total    self
/gnu/store/@dots{}-coreutils-8.24          77.8    13.8  13.4%
/gnu/store/@dots{}-grep-2.22               73.1     0.8   0.8%
/gnu/store/@dots{}-bash-4.3.42             72.3     4.7   4.6%
/gnu/store/@dots{}-readline-6.3            67.6     1.2   1.2%
@dots{}
total: 102.3 MiB
@end example

@noindent
In this example we see that the combination of the four packages takes
102.3@tie{}MiB in total, which is much less than the sum of each closure
since they have a lot of dependencies in common.

The available options are:

@table @option

@item --substitute-urls=@var{urls}
Use substitute information from @var{urls}.
@xref{client-substitute-urls, the same option for @code{guix build}}.

@item --sort=@var{key}
Sort lines according to @var{key}, one of the following options:

@table @code
@item self
the size of each item (the default);
@item closure
the total size of the item's closure.
@end table

@item --map-file=@var{file}
Write a graphical map of disk usage in PNG format to @var{file}.

For the example above, the map looks like this:

@image{images/coreutils-size-map,5in,, map of Coreutils disk usage
produced by @command{guix size}}

This option requires that
@uref{http://wingolog.org/software/guile-charting/, Guile-Charting} be
installed and visible in Guile's module search path.  When that is not
the case, @command{guix size} fails as it tries to load it.

@item --system=@var{system}
@itemx -s @var{system}
Consider packages for @var{system}---e.g., @code{x86_64-linux}.

@end table

@node Invoking guix graph
@section Invoking @command{guix graph}

@cindex DAG
@cindex @command{guix graph}
@cindex package dependencies
Packages and their dependencies form a @dfn{graph}, specifically a
directed acyclic graph (DAG).  It can quickly become difficult to have a
mental model of the package DAG, so the @command{guix graph} command
provides a visual representation of the DAG.  By default,
@command{guix graph} emits a DAG representation in the input format of
@uref{http://www.graphviz.org/, Graphviz}, so its output can be passed
directly to the @command{dot} command of Graphviz.  It can also emit an
HTML page with embedded JavaScript code to display a ``chord diagram''
in a Web browser, using the @uref{https://d3js.org/, d3.js} library, or
emit Cypher queries to construct a graph in a graph database supporting
the @uref{http://www.opencypher.org/, openCypher} query language.
The general syntax is:

@example
guix graph @var{options} @var{package}@dots{}
@end example

For example, the following command generates a PDF file representing the
package DAG for the GNU@tie{}Core Utilities, showing its build-time
dependencies:

@example
guix graph coreutils | dot -Tpdf > dag.pdf
@end example

The output looks like this:

@image{images/coreutils-graph,2in,,Dependency graph of the GNU Coreutils}

Nice little graph, no?

But there is more than one graph!  The one above is concise: it is the
graph of package objects, omitting implicit inputs such as GCC, libc,
grep, etc.  It is often useful to have such a concise graph, but
sometimes one may want to see more details.  @command{guix graph} supports
several types of graphs, allowing you to choose the level of detail:

@table @code
@item package
This is the default type used in the example above.  It shows the DAG of
package objects, excluding implicit dependencies.  It is concise, but
filters out many details.

@item reverse-package
This shows the @emph{reverse} DAG of packages.  For example:

@example
guix graph --type=reverse-package ocaml
@end example

...@: yields the graph of packages that @emph{explicitly} depend on OCaml (if
you are also interested in cases where OCaml is an implicit dependency, see
@code{reverse-bag} below.)

Note that for core packages this can yield huge graphs.  If all you want
is to know the number of packages that depend on a given package, use
@command{guix refresh --list-dependent} (@pxref{Invoking guix refresh,
@option{--list-dependent}}).

@item bag-emerged
This is the package DAG, @emph{including} implicit inputs.

For instance, the following command:

@example
guix graph --type=bag-emerged coreutils | dot -Tpdf > dag.pdf
@end example

...@: yields this bigger graph:

@image{images/coreutils-bag-graph,,5in,Detailed dependency graph of the GNU Coreutils}

At the bottom of the graph, we see all the implicit inputs of
@var{gnu-build-system} (@pxref{Build Systems, @code{gnu-build-system}}).

Now, note that the dependencies of these implicit inputs---that is, the
@dfn{bootstrap dependencies} (@pxref{Bootstrapping})---are not shown
here, for conciseness.

@item bag
Similar to @code{bag-emerged}, but this time including all the bootstrap
dependencies.

@item bag-with-origins
Similar to @code{bag}, but also showing origins and their dependencies.

@item reverse-bag
This shows the @emph{reverse} DAG of packages.  Unlike @code{reverse-package},
it also takes implicit dependencies into account.  For example:

@example
guix graph -t reverse-bag dune
@end example

@noindent
...@: yields the graph of all packages that depend on Dune, directly or
indirectly.  Since Dune is an @emph{implicit} dependency of many packages
@i{via} @code{dune-build-system}, this shows a large number of packages,
whereas @code{reverse-package} would show very few if any.

@item derivation
This is the most detailed representation: It shows the DAG of
derivations (@pxref{Derivations}) and plain store items.  Compared to
the above representation, many additional nodes are visible, including
build scripts, patches, Guile modules, etc.

For this type of graph, it is also possible to pass a @file{.drv} file
name instead of a package name, as in:

@example
guix graph -t derivation `guix system build -d my-config.scm`
@end example

@item module
This is the graph of @dfn{package modules} (@pxref{Package Modules}).
For example, the following command shows the graph for the package
module that defines the @code{guile} package:

@example
guix graph -t module guile | dot -Tpdf > module-graph.pdf
@end example
@end table

All the types above correspond to @emph{build-time dependencies}.  The
following graph type represents the @emph{run-time dependencies}:

@table @code
@item references
This is the graph of @dfn{references} of a package output, as returned
by @command{guix gc --references} (@pxref{Invoking guix gc}).

If the given package output is not available in the store, @command{guix
graph} attempts to obtain dependency information from substitutes.

Here you can also pass a store file name instead of a package name.  For
example, the command below produces the reference graph of your profile
(which can be big!):

@example
guix graph -t references `readlink -f ~/.guix-profile`
@end example

@item referrers
This is the graph of the @dfn{referrers} of a store item, as returned by
@command{guix gc --referrers} (@pxref{Invoking guix gc}).

This relies exclusively on local information from your store.  For
instance, let us suppose that the current Inkscape is available in 10
profiles on your machine; @command{guix graph -t referrers inkscape}
will show a graph rooted at Inkscape and with those 10 profiles linked
to it.

It can help determine what is preventing a store item from being garbage
collected.

@end table

The available options are the following:

@table @option
@item --type=@var{type}
@itemx -t @var{type}
Produce a graph output of @var{type}, where @var{type} must be one of
the values listed above.

@item --list-types
List the supported graph types.

@item --backend=@var{backend}
@itemx -b @var{backend}
Produce a graph using the selected @var{backend}.

@item --list-backends
List the supported graph backends.

Currently, the available backends are Graphviz and d3.js.

@item --expression=@var{expr}
@itemx -e @var{expr}
Consider the package @var{expr} evaluates to.

This is useful to precisely refer to a package, as in this example:

@example
guix graph -e '(@@@@ (gnu packages commencement) gnu-make-final)'
@end example

@item --system=@var{system}
@itemx -s @var{system}
Display the graph for @var{system}---e.g., @code{i686-linux}.

The package dependency graph is largely architecture-independent, but there
are some architecture-dependent bits that this option allows you to visualize.
@end table



@node Invoking guix publish
@section Invoking @command{guix publish}

@cindex @command{guix publish}
The purpose of @command{guix publish} is to enable users to easily share
their store with others, who can then use it as a substitute server
(@pxref{Substitutes}).

When @command{guix publish} runs, it spawns an HTTP server which allows
anyone with network access to obtain substitutes from it.  This means
that any machine running Guix can also act as if it were a build farm,
since the HTTP interface is compatible with Hydra, the software behind
the @code{@value{SUBSTITUTE-SERVER}} build farm.

For security, each substitute is signed, allowing recipients to check
their authenticity and integrity (@pxref{Substitutes}).  Because
@command{guix publish} uses the signing key of the system, which is only
readable by the system administrator, it must be started as root; the
@code{--user} option makes it drop root privileges early on.

The signing key pair must be generated before @command{guix publish} is
launched, using @command{guix archive --generate-key} (@pxref{Invoking
guix archive}).

The general syntax is:

@example
guix publish @var{options}@dots{}
@end example

Running @command{guix publish} without any additional arguments will
spawn an HTTP server on port 8080:

@example
guix publish
@end example

Once a publishing server has been authorized (@pxref{Invoking guix
archive}), the daemon may download substitutes from it:

@example
guix-daemon --substitute-urls=http://example.org:8080
@end example

By default, @command{guix publish} compresses archives on the fly as it
serves them.  This ``on-the-fly'' mode is convenient in that it requires
no setup and is immediately available.  However, when serving lots of
clients, we recommend using the @option{--cache} option, which enables
caching of the archives before they are sent to clients---see below for
details.  The @command{guix weather} command provides a handy way to
check what a server provides (@pxref{Invoking guix weather}).

As a bonus, @command{guix publish} also serves as a content-addressed
mirror for source files referenced in @code{origin} records
(@pxref{origin Reference}).  For instance, assuming @command{guix
publish} is running on @code{example.org}, the following URL returns the
raw @file{hello-2.10.tar.gz} file with the given SHA256 hash
(represented in @code{nix-base32} format, @pxref{Invoking guix hash}):

@example
http://example.org/file/hello-2.10.tar.gz/sha256/0ssi1@dots{}ndq1i
@end example

Obviously, these URLs only work for files that are in the store; in
other cases, they return 404 (``Not Found'').

@cindex build logs, publication
Build logs are available from @code{/log} URLs like:

@example
http://example.org/log/gwspk@dots{}-guile-2.2.3
@end example

@noindent
When @command{guix-daemon} is configured to save compressed build logs,
as is the case by default (@pxref{Invoking guix-daemon}), @code{/log}
URLs return the compressed log as-is, with an appropriate
@code{Content-Type} and/or @code{Content-Encoding} header.  We recommend
running @command{guix-daemon} with @code{--log-compression=gzip} since
Web browsers can automatically decompress it, which is not the case with
bzip2 compression.

The following options are available:

@table @code
@item --port=@var{port}
@itemx -p @var{port}
Listen for HTTP requests on @var{port}.

@item --listen=@var{host}
Listen on the network interface for @var{host}.  The default is to
accept connections from any interface.

@item --user=@var{user}
@itemx -u @var{user}
Change privileges to @var{user} as soon as possible---i.e., once the
server socket is open and the signing key has been read.

@item --compression[=@var{level}]
@itemx -C [@var{level}]
Compress data using the given @var{level}.  When @var{level} is zero,
disable compression.  The range 1 to 9 corresponds to different gzip
compression levels: 1 is the fastest, and 9 is the best (CPU-intensive).
The default is 3.

Unless @option{--cache} is used, compression occurs on the fly and
the compressed streams are not
cached.  Thus, to reduce load on the machine that runs @command{guix
publish}, it may be a good idea to choose a low compression level, to
run @command{guix publish} behind a caching proxy, or to use
@option{--cache}.  Using @option{--cache} has the advantage that it
allows @command{guix publish} to add @code{Content-Length} HTTP header
to its responses.

@item --cache=@var{directory}
@itemx -c @var{directory}
Cache archives and meta-data (@code{.narinfo} URLs) to @var{directory}
and only serve archives that are in cache.

When this option is omitted, archives and meta-data are created
on-the-fly.  This can reduce the available bandwidth, especially when
compression is enabled, since this may become CPU-bound.  Another
drawback of the default mode is that the length of archives is not known
in advance, so @command{guix publish} does not add a
@code{Content-Length} HTTP header to its responses, which in turn
prevents clients from knowing the amount of data being downloaded.

Conversely, when @option{--cache} is used, the first request for a store
item (@i{via} a @code{.narinfo} URL) returns 404 and triggers a
background process to @dfn{bake} the archive---computing its
@code{.narinfo} and compressing the archive, if needed.  Once the
archive is cached in @var{directory}, subsequent requests succeed and
are served directly from the cache, which guarantees that clients get
the best possible bandwidth.

The ``baking'' process is performed by worker threads.  By default, one
thread per CPU core is created, but this can be customized.  See
@option{--workers} below.

When @option{--ttl} is used, cached entries are automatically deleted
when they have expired.

@item --workers=@var{N}
When @option{--cache} is used, request the allocation of @var{N} worker
threads to ``bake'' archives.

@item --ttl=@var{ttl}
Produce @code{Cache-Control} HTTP headers that advertise a time-to-live
(TTL) of @var{ttl}.  @var{ttl} must denote a duration: @code{5d} means 5
days, @code{1m} means 1 month, and so on.

This allows the user's Guix to keep substitute information in cache for
@var{ttl}.  However, note that @code{guix publish} does not itself
guarantee that the store items it provides will indeed remain available
for as long as @var{ttl}.

Additionally, when @option{--cache} is used, cached entries that have
not been accessed for @var{ttl} and that no longer have a corresponding
item in the store, may be deleted.

@item --nar-path=@var{path}
Use @var{path} as the prefix for the URLs of ``nar'' files
(@pxref{Invoking guix archive, normalized archives}).

By default, nars are served at a URL such as
@code{/nar/gzip/@dots{}-coreutils-8.25}.  This option allows you to
change the @code{/nar} part to @var{path}.

@item --public-key=@var{file}
@itemx --private-key=@var{file}
Use the specific @var{file}s as the public/private key pair used to sign
the store items being published.

The files must correspond to the same key pair (the private key is used
for signing and the public key is merely advertised in the signature
metadata).  They must contain keys in the canonical s-expression format
as produced by @command{guix archive --generate-key} (@pxref{Invoking
guix archive}).  By default, @file{/etc/guix/signing-key.pub} and
@file{/etc/guix/signing-key.sec} are used.

@item --repl[=@var{port}]
@itemx -r [@var{port}]
Spawn a Guile REPL server (@pxref{REPL Servers,,, guile, GNU Guile
Reference Manual}) on @var{port} (37146 by default).  This is used
primarily for debugging a running @command{guix publish} server.
@end table

Enabling @command{guix publish} on Guix System is a one-liner: just
instantiate a @code{guix-publish-service-type} service in the @code{services} field
of the @code{operating-system} declaration (@pxref{guix-publish-service-type,
@code{guix-publish-service-type}}).

If you are instead running Guix on a ``foreign distro'', follow these
instructions:”

@itemize
@item
If your host distro uses the systemd init system:

The former is obviously an important question: Before using a substitute

provides the right binaries, and thus @emph{challenge} it.  The latter
is what enables the former: If package builds are deterministic, then
independent builds of the package should yield the exact same result,
bit for bit; if a server provides a binary different from the one
obtained locally, it may be either corrupt or malicious.

We know that the hash that shows up in @file{/gnu/store} file names is
the hash of all the inputs of the process that built the file or
directory---compilers, libraries, build scripts,
etc. (@pxref{Introduction}).  Assuming deterministic build processes,
one store file name should map to exactly one build output.
@command{guix challenge} checks whether there is, indeed, a single
mapping by comparing the build outputs of several independent builds of
any given store item.

The command output looks like this:

@smallexample
$ guix challenge --substitute-urls="https://@value{SUBSTITUTE-SERVER} https://guix.example.org"

@dots{}

6,406 store items were analyzed:
  - 4,749 (74.1%) were identical
  - 525 (8.2%) differed
  - 1,132 (17.7%) were inconclusive
@end smallexample

@noindent
In this example, @command{guix challenge} first scans the store to
determine the set of locally-built derivations---as opposed to store
items that were downloaded from a substitute server---and then queries
all the substitute servers.  It then reports those store items for which
the servers obtained a result different from the local build.

@cindex non-determinism, in package builds
As an example, @code{guix.example.org} always gets a different answer.
Conversely, @code{@value{SUBSTITUTE-SERVER}} agrees with local builds, except in the
case of Git.  This might indicate that the build process of Git is
non-deterministic, meaning that its output varies as a function of
various things that Guix does not fully control, in spite of building
packages in isolated environments (@pxref{Features}).  Most common
sources of non-determinism include the addition of timestamps in build
results, the inclusion of random numbers, and directory listings sorted
by inode number.  See @uref{https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/}, for
more information.

To find out what is wrong with this Git binary, we can do something along
these lines (@pxref{Invoking guix archive}):

@example
$ wget -q -O - https://@value{SUBSTITUTE-SERVER}/nar/@dots{}-git-2.5.0 \
   | guix archive -x /tmp/git
$ diff -ur --no-dereference /gnu/store/@dots{}-git.2.5.0 /tmp/git
@end example

This command shows the difference between the files resulting from the
local build, and the files resulting from the build on
@code{@value{SUBSTITUTE-SERVER}} (@pxref{Overview, Comparing and Merging Files,,
diffutils, Comparing and Merging Files}).  The @command{diff} command
works great for text files.  When binary files differ, a better option
is @uref{https://diffoscope.org/, Diffoscope}, a tool that helps
visualize differences for all kinds of files.

Once you have done that work, you can tell whether the differences are due
to a non-deterministic build process or to a malicious server.  We try
hard to remove sources of non-determinism in packages to make it easier
to verify substitutes, but of course, this is a process that
involves not just Guix, but a large part of the free software community.
In the meantime, @command{guix challenge} is one tool to help address
the problem.

If you are writing packages for Guix, you are encouraged to check
whether @code{@value{SUBSTITUTE-SERVER}} and other substitute servers obtain the
same build result as you did with:

@example
$ guix challenge @var{package}
@end example

@noindent
where @var{package} is a package specification such as
@code{guile@@2.0} or @code{glibc:debug}.

The general syntax is:

@example
guix challenge @var{options} [@var{packages}@dots{}]
@end example

When a difference is found between the hash of a locally-built item and
that of a server-provided substitute, or among substitutes provided by
different servers, the command displays it as in the example above and
its exit code is 2 (other non-zero exit codes denote other kinds of
errors.)

The one option that matters is:

@table @code

@item --substitute-urls=@var{urls}
Consider @var{urls} the whitespace-separated list of substitute source
URLs to compare to.

@item --verbose
@itemx -v
Show details about matches (identical contents) in addition to
information about mismatches.

@end table

@node Invoking guix copy
@section Invoking @command{guix copy}

@cindex copy, of store items, over SSH
@cindex SSH, copy of store items
@cindex sharing store items across machines
@cindex transferring store items across machines
The @command{guix copy} command copies items from the store of one
machine to that of another machine over a secure shell (SSH)
connection@footnote{This command is available only when Guile-SSH was
found.  @xref{Requirements}, for details.}.  For example, the following
command copies the @code{coreutils} package, the user's profile, and all
their dependencies over to @var{host}, logged in as @var{user}:

@example
guix copy --to=@var{user}@@@var{host} \
          coreutils `readlink -f ~/.guix-profile`
@end example

If some of the items to be copied are already present on @var{host},
they are not actually sent.

The command below retrieves @code{libreoffice} and @code{gimp} from
@var{host}, assuming they are available there:

@example
guix copy --from=@var{host} libreoffice gimp
@end example

The SSH connection is established using the Guile-SSH client, which is
compatible with OpenSSH: it honors @file{~/.ssh/known_hosts} and
@file{~/.ssh/config}, and uses the SSH agent for authentication.

The key used to sign items that are sent must be accepted by the remote
machine.  Likewise, the key used by the remote machine to sign items you
are retrieving must be in @file{/etc/guix/acl} so it is accepted by your
own daemon.  @xref{Invoking guix archive}, for more information about
store item authentication.

The general syntax is:

@example
guix copy [--to=@var{spec}|--from=@var{spec}] @var{items}@dots{}
@end example

You must always specify one of the following options:

@table @code
@item --to=@var{spec}
@itemx --from=@var{spec}
Specify the host to send to or receive from.  @var{spec} must be an SSH
spec such as @code{example.org}, @code{charlie@@example.org}, or
@code{charlie@@example.org:2222}.
@end table

The @var{items} can be either package names, such as @code{gimp}, or
store items, such as @file{/gnu/store/@dots{}-idutils-4.6}.

When specifying the name of a package to send, it is first built if
needed, unless @option{--dry-run} was specified.  Common build options
are supported (@pxref{Common Build Options}).


@node Invoking guix container
@section Invoking @command{guix container}
@cindex container
@cindex @command{guix container}
@quotation Note
As of version @value{VERSION}, this tool is experimental.  The interface
is subject to radical change in the future.
@end quotation

The purpose of @command{guix container} is to manipulate processes
running within an isolated environment, commonly known as a
``container'', typically created by the @command{guix environment}
(@pxref{Invoking guix environment}) and @command{guix system container}
(@pxref{Invoking guix system}) commands.

The general syntax is:

@example
guix container @var{action} @var{options}@dots{}
@end example

@var{action} specifies the operation to perform with a container, and
@var{options} specifies the context-specific arguments for the action.

The following actions are available:

@table @code
@item exec
Execute a command within the context of a running container.

The syntax is:

@example
guix container exec @var{pid} @var{program} @var{arguments}@dots{}
@end example

@var{pid} specifies the process ID of the running container.
@var{program} specifies an executable file name within the root file
system of the container.  @var{arguments} are the additional options that
will be passed to @var{program}.

The following command launches an interactive login shell inside a
Guix system container, started by @command{guix system container}, and whose
process ID is 9001:

@example
guix container exec 9001 /run/current-system/profile/bin/bash --login
@end example

Note that the @var{pid} cannot be the parent process of a container.  It
must be PID 1 of the container or one of its child processes.

@end table

@node Invoking guix weather
@section Invoking @command{guix weather}

Occasionally you're grumpy because substitutes are lacking and you end
up building packages by yourself (@pxref{Substitutes}).  The
@command{guix weather} command reports on substitute availability on the
specified servers so you can have an idea of whether you'll be grumpy
today.  It can sometimes be useful info as a user, but it is primarily
useful to people running @command{guix publish} (@pxref{Invoking guix
publish}).

@cindex statistics, for substitutes
@cindex availability of substitutes
@cindex substitute availability
@cindex weather, substitute availability
Here's a sample run:

@example
$ guix weather --substitute-urls=https://guix.example.org
computing 5,872 package derivations for x86_64-linux...
looking for 6,128 store items on https://guix.example.org..

https://guix.example.org
  43.4% substitutes available (2,658 out of 6,128)
  7,032.5 MiB of nars (compressed)
  19,824.2 MiB on disk (uncompressed)
  0.030 seconds per request (182.9 seconds in total)
  33.5 requests per second

  9.8% (342 out of 3,470) of the missing items are queued
  867 queued builds
      x86_64-linux: 518 (59.7%)
      i686-linux: 221 (25.5%)
      aarch64-linux: 128 (14.8%)
  build rate: 23.41 builds per hour
      x86_64-linux: 11.16 builds per hour
      i686-linux: 6.03 builds per hour
      aarch64-linux: 6.41 builds per hour
@end example

@cindex continuous integration, statistics
As you can see, it reports the fraction of all the packages for which
substitutes are available on the server---regardless of whether
substitutes are enabled, and regardless of whether this server's signing
key is authorized.  It also reports the size of the compressed archives
(``nars'') provided by the server, the size the corresponding store
items occupy in the store (assuming deduplication is turned off), and
the server's throughput.  The second part gives continuous integration
(CI) statistics, if the server supports it.  In addition, using the
@option{--coverage} option, @command{guix weather} can list ``important''
package substitutes missing on the server (see below).

To achieve that, @command{guix weather} queries over HTTP(S) meta-data
(@dfn{narinfos}) for all the relevant store items.  Like @command{guix
challenge}, it ignores signatures on those substitutes, which is
innocuous since the command only gathers statistics and cannot install
those substitutes.

Among other things, it is possible to query specific system types and
specific package sets.  The available options are listed below.

@table @code
@item --substitute-urls=@var{urls}
@var{urls} is the space-separated list of substitute server URLs to
query.  When this option is omitted, the default set of substitute
servers is queried.

@item --system=@var{system}
@itemx -s @var{system}
Query substitutes for @var{system}---e.g., @code{aarch64-linux}.  This
option can be repeated, in which case @command{guix weather} will query
substitutes for several system types.

@item --manifest=@var{file}
Instead of querying substitutes for all the packages, only ask for those
specified in @var{file}.  @var{file} must contain a @dfn{manifest}, as
with the @code{-m} option of @command{guix package} (@pxref{Invoking
guix package}).

@item --coverage[=@var{count}]
@itemx -c [@var{count}]
Report on substitute coverage for packages: list packages with at least
@var{count} dependents (zero by default) for which substitutes are
unavailable.  Dependent packages themselves are not listed: if @var{b} depends
on @var{a} and @var{a} has no substitutes, only @var{a} is listed, even though
@var{b} usually lacks substitutes as well.  The result looks like this:

@example
$ guix weather --substitute-urls=https://ci.guix.info -c 10
computing 8,983 package derivations for x86_64-linux...
looking for 9,343 store items on https://ci.guix.info...
updating substitutes from 'https://ci.guix.info'... 100.0%
https://ci.guix.info
  64.7% substitutes available (6,047 out of 9,343)
@dots{}
2502 packages are missing from 'https://ci.guix.info' for 'x86_64-linux', among which:
    58  kcoreaddons@@5.49.0      /gnu/store/@dots{}-kcoreaddons-5.49.0
    46  qgpgme@@1.11.1           /gnu/store/@dots{}-qgpgme-1.11.1
    37  perl-http-cookiejar@@0.008  /gnu/store/@dots{}-perl-http-cookiejar-0.008
    @dots{}
@end example

What this example shows is that @code{kcoreaddons} and presumably the 58
packages that depend on it have no substitutes at @code{ci.guix.info};
likewise for @code{qgpgme} and the 46 packages that depend on it.

If you are a Guix developer, or if you are taking care of this build farm,
you'll probably want to have a closer look at these packages: they may simply
fail to build.
@end table

@node Invoking guix processes
@section Invoking @command{guix processes}

The @command{guix processes} command can be useful to developers and system
administrators, especially on multi-user machines and on build farms: it lists
the current sessions (connections to the daemon), as well as information about
the processes involved@footnote{Remote sessions, when @command{guix-daemon} is
started with @option{--listen} specifying a TCP endpoint, are @emph{not}
listed.}.  Here's an example of the information it returns:

@example
$ sudo guix processes
SessionPID: 19002
ClientPID: 19090
ClientCommand: guix environment --ad-hoc python

SessionPID: 19402
ClientPID: 19367
ClientCommand: guix publish -u guix-publish -p 3000 -C 9 @dots{}

SessionPID: 19444
ClientPID: 19419
ClientCommand: cuirass --cache-directory /var/cache/cuirass @dots{}
LockHeld: /gnu/store/@dots{}-perl-ipc-cmd-0.96.lock
LockHeld: /gnu/store/@dots{}-python-six-bootstrap-1.11.0.lock
LockHeld: /gnu/store/@dots{}-libjpeg-turbo-2.0.0.lock
ChildProcess: 20495: guix offload x86_64-linux 7200 1 28800
ChildProcess: 27733: guix offload x86_64-linux 7200 1 28800
ChildProcess: 27793: guix offload x86_64-linux 7200 1 28800
@end example

In this example we see that @command{guix-daemon} has three clients:
@command{guix environment}, @command{guix publish}, and the Cuirass continuous
integration tool; their process identifier (PID) is given by the
@code{ClientPID} field.  The @code{SessionPID} field gives the PID of the
@command{guix-daemon} sub-process of this particular session.

The @code{LockHeld} fields show which store items are currently locked by this
session, which corresponds to store items being built or substituted (the
@code{LockHeld} field is not displayed when @command{guix processes} is not
running as root.)  Last, by looking at the @code{ChildProcess} field, we
understand that these three builds are being offloaded (@pxref{Daemon Offload
Setup}).

The output is in Recutils format so we can use the handy @command{recsel}
command to select sessions of interest (@pxref{Selection Expressions,,,
recutils, GNU recutils manual}).  As an example, the command shows the command
line and PID of the client that triggered the build of a Perl package:

@example
$ sudo guix processes | \
    recsel -p ClientPID,ClientCommand -e 'LockHeld ~ "perl"'
ClientPID: 19419
ClientCommand: cuirass --cache-directory /var/cache/cuirass @dots{}
@end example


@node System Configuration
@chapter System Configuration

@cindex system configuration
The Guix System Distribution supports a consistent whole-system configuration
mechanism.  By that we mean that all aspects of the global system
configuration---such as the available system services, timezone and
locale settings, user accounts---are declared in a single place.  Such
a @dfn{system configuration} can be @dfn{instantiated}---i.e., effected.

One of the advantages of putting all the system configuration under the
control of Guix is that it supports transactional system upgrades, and
makes it possible to roll back to a previous system instantiation,
should something go wrong with the new one (@pxref{Features}).  Another
advantage is that it makes it easy to replicate the exact same configuration
across different machines, or at different points in time, without
having to resort to additional administration tools layered on top of
the own tools of the system.
@c Yes, we're talking of Puppet, Chef, & co. here.  ↑

This section describes this mechanism.  First we focus on the system
administrator's viewpoint---explaining how the system is configured and
instantiated.  Then we show how this mechanism can be extended, for
instance to support new system services.

@node Using the Configuration System
@section Using the Configuration System

The operating system is configured by providing an
@code{operating-system} declaration in a file that can then be passed to
the @command{guix system} command (@pxref{Invoking guix system}).  A
simple setup, with the default system services, the default Linux-Libre
kernel, initial RAM disk, and boot loader looks like this:

@findex operating-system
@lisp
@include os-config-bare-bones.texi
@end lisp

This example should be self-describing.  Some of the fields defined
above, such as @code{host-name} and @code{bootloader}, are mandatory.
Others, such as @code{packages} and @code{services}, can be omitted, in
which case they get a default value.

Below we discuss the effect of some of the most important fields
(@pxref{operating-system Reference}, for details about all the available
fields), and how to @dfn{instantiate} the operating system using
@command{guix system}.

@unnumberedsubsec Bootloader

@cindex legacy boot, on Intel machines
@cindex BIOS boot, on Intel machines
@cindex UEFI boot
@cindex EFI boot
The @code{bootloader} field describes the method that will be used to boot
your system.  Machines based on Intel processors can boot in ``legacy'' BIOS
mode, as in the example above.  However, more recent machines rely instead on
the @dfn{Unified Extensible Firmware Interface} (UEFI) to boot.  In that case,
the @code{bootloader} field should contain something along these lines:

@example
(bootloader-configuration
  (bootloader grub-efi-bootloader)
  (target "/boot/efi"))
@end example

@xref{Bootloader Configuration}, for more information on the available
configuration options.

@unnumberedsubsec Globally-Visible Packages

@vindex %base-packages
The @code{packages} field lists packages that will be globally visible
on the system, for all user accounts---i.e., in every user's @code{PATH}
environment variable---in addition to the per-user profiles
(@pxref{Invoking guix package}).  The @var{%base-packages} variable
provides all the tools one would expect for basic user and administrator
tasks---including the GNU Core Utilities, the GNU Networking Utilities,
the GNU Zile lightweight text editor, @command{find}, @command{grep},
etc.  The example above adds GNU@tie{}Screen to those,
taken from the @code{(gnu packages screen)}
module (@pxref{Package Modules}).  The
@code{(list package output)} syntax can be used to add a specific output
of a package:

@lisp
(use-modules (gnu packages))
(use-modules (gnu packages dns))

(operating-system
  ;; ...
  (packages (cons (list bind "utils")
                  %base-packages)))
@end lisp

@findex specification->package
Referring to packages by variable name, like @code{bind} above, has
the advantage of being unambiguous; it also allows typos and such to be
diagnosed right away as ``unbound variables''.  The downside is that one
needs to know which module defines which package, and to augment the
@code{use-package-modules} line accordingly.  To avoid that, one can use
the @code{specification->package} procedure of the @code{(gnu packages)}
module, which returns the best package for a given name or name and
version:

@lisp
(use-modules (gnu packages))

(operating-system
  ;; ...
  (packages (append (map specification->package
                         '("tcpdump" "htop" "gnupg@@2.0"))
                    %base-packages)))
@end lisp

@unnumberedsubsec System Services

@cindex services
@vindex %base-services
The @code{services} field lists @dfn{system services} to be made
available when the system starts (@pxref{Services}).
The @code{operating-system} declaration above specifies that, in
addition to the basic services, we want the OpenSSH secure shell
daemon listening on port 2222 (@pxref{Networking Services,
@code{openssh-service-type}}).  Under the hood,
@code{openssh-service-type} arranges so that @command{sshd} is started with the
right command-line options, possibly with supporting configuration files
generated as needed (@pxref{Defining Services}).

@cindex customization, of services
@findex modify-services
Occasionally, instead of using the base services as is, you will want to
customize them.  To do this, use @code{modify-services} (@pxref{Service
Reference, @code{modify-services}}) to modify the list.

For example, suppose you want to modify @code{guix-daemon} and Mingetty
(the console log-in) in the @var{%base-services} list (@pxref{Base
Services, @code{%base-services}}).  To do that, you can write the
following in your operating system declaration:

@lisp
(define %my-services
  ;; My very own list of services.
  (modify-services %base-services
    (guix-service-type config =>
                       (guix-configuration
                        (inherit config)
                        (use-substitutes? #f)
                        (extra-options '("--gc-keep-derivations"))))
    (mingetty-service-type config =>
                           (mingetty-configuration
                            (inherit config)))))

(operating-system
  ;; @dots{}
  (services %my-services))
@end lisp

This changes the configuration---i.e., the service parameters---of the
@code{guix-service-type} instance, and that of all the
@code{mingetty-service-type} instances in the @var{%base-services} list.
Observe how this is accomplished: first, we arrange for the original
configuration to be bound to the identifier @code{config} in the
@var{body}, and then we write the @var{body} so that it evaluates to the
desired configuration.  In particular, notice how we use @code{inherit}
to create a new configuration which has the same values as the old
configuration, but with a few modifications.

@cindex encrypted disk
The configuration for a typical ``desktop'' usage, with an encrypted
root partition, the X11 display
server, GNOME and Xfce (users can choose which of these desktop
environments to use at the log-in screen by pressing @kbd{F1}), network
management, power management, and more, would look like this:

@lisp
@include os-config-desktop.texi
@end lisp

A graphical system with a choice of lightweight window managers
instead of full-blown desktop environments would look like this:

@lisp
@include os-config-lightweight-desktop.texi
@end lisp

This example refers to the @file{/boot/efi} file system by its UUID,
@code{1234-ABCD}.  Replace this UUID with the right UUID on your system,
as returned by the @command{blkid} command.

@xref{Desktop Services}, for the exact list of services provided by
@var{%desktop-services}.  @xref{X.509 Certificates}, for background
information about the @code{nss-certs} package that is used here.

Again, @var{%desktop-services} is just a list of service objects.  If
you want to remove services from there, you can do so using the
procedures for list filtering (@pxref{SRFI-1 Filtering and
Partitioning,,, guile, GNU Guile Reference Manual}).  For instance, the
following expression returns a list that contains all the services in
@var{%desktop-services} minus the Avahi service:

@example
(remove (lambda (service)
          (eq? (service-kind service) avahi-service-type))
        %desktop-services)
@end example

@unnumberedsubsec Instantiating the System

Assuming the @code{operating-system} declaration
is stored in the @file{my-system-config.scm}
file, the @command{guix system reconfigure my-system-config.scm} command
instantiates that configuration, and makes it the default GRUB boot
entry (@pxref{Invoking guix system}).

The normal way to change the system configuration is by updating this
file and re-running @command{guix system reconfigure}.  One should never
have to touch files in @file{/etc} or to run commands that modify the
system state such as @command{useradd} or @command{grub-install}.  In
fact, you must avoid that since that would not only void your warranty
but also prevent you from rolling back to previous versions of your
system, should you ever need to.

@cindex roll-back, of the operating system
Speaking of roll-back, each time you run @command{guix system
reconfigure}, a new @dfn{generation} of the system is created---without
modifying or deleting previous generations.  Old system generations get
an entry in the bootloader boot menu, allowing you to boot them in case
something went wrong with the latest generation.  Reassuring, no?  The
@command{guix system list-generations} command lists the system
generations available on disk.  It is also possible to roll back the
system via the commands @command{guix system roll-back} and
@command{guix system switch-generation}.

Although the @command{guix system reconfigure} command will not modify
previous generations, you must take care when the current generation is not
the latest (e.g., after invoking @command{guix system roll-back}), since
the operation might overwrite a later generation (@pxref{Invoking guix
system}).

@unnumberedsubsec The Programming Interface

At the Scheme level, the bulk of an @code{operating-system} declaration
is instantiated with the following monadic procedure (@pxref{The Store
Monad}):

@deffn {Monadic Procedure} operating-system-derivation os
Return a derivation that builds @var{os}, an @code{operating-system}
object (@pxref{Derivations}).

The output of the derivation is a single directory that refers to all
the packages, configuration files, and other supporting files needed to
instantiate @var{os}.
@end deffn

This procedure is provided by the @code{(gnu system)} module.  Along
with @code{(gnu services)} (@pxref{Services}), this module contains the
guts of Guix System.  Make sure to visit it!


@node operating-system Reference
@section @code{operating-system} Reference

This section summarizes all the options available in
@code{operating-system} declarations (@pxref{Using the Configuration
System}).

@deftp {Data Type} operating-system
This is the data type representing an operating system configuration.
By that, we mean all the global system configuration, not per-user
configuration (@pxref{Using the Configuration System}).

@table @asis
@item @code{kernel} (default: @var{linux-libre})
The package object of the operating system kernel to use@footnote{Currently
only the Linux-libre kernel is supported.  In the future, it will be

the command-line of the kernel---e.g., @code{("console=ttyS0")}.

@item @code{bootloader}
The system bootloader configuration object.  @xref{Bootloader Configuration}.

@item @code{keyboard-layout} (default: @code{#f})
This field specifies the keyboard layout to use in the console.  It can be
either @code{#f}, in which case the default keyboard layout is used (usually
US English), or a @code{<keyboard-layout>} record.

This keyboard layout is in effect as soon as the kernel has booted.  For
instance, it is the keyboard layout in effect when you type a passphrase if
your root file system is on a @code{luks-device-mapping} mapped device
(@pxref{Mapped Devices}).

@quotation Note
This does @emph{not} specify the keyboard layout used by the bootloader, nor
that used by the graphical display server.  @xref{Bootloader Configuration},
for information on how to specify the bootloader's keyboard layout.  @xref{X
Window}, for information on how to specify the keyboard layout used by the X
Window System.
@end quotation

should rarely be needed for casual use.  @xref{Initial RAM Disk}.

@item @code{firmware} (default: @var{%base-firmware})
@cindex firmware
List of firmware packages loadable by the operating system kernel.

The default includes firmware needed for Atheros- and Broadcom-based

respectively).  @xref{Hardware Considerations}, for more info on
supported hardware.

@item @code{host-name}
The host name.

@item @code{hosts-file}
@cindex hosts file
A file-like object (@pxref{G-Expressions, file-like objects}) for use as
@file{/etc/hosts} (@pxref{Host Names,,, libc, The GNU C Library
Reference Manual}).  The default is a file with entries for
@code{localhost} and @var{host-name}.

@item @code{mapped-devices} (default: @code{'()})
A list of mapped devices.  @xref{Mapped Devices}.

@item @code{file-systems}
A list of file systems.  @xref{File Systems}.

@item @code{swap-devices} (default: @code{'()})
@cindex swap devices
A list of strings identifying devices or files to be used for ``swap
space'' (@pxref{Memory Concepts,,, libc, The GNU C Library Reference
Manual}).  For example, @code{'("/dev/sda3")} or @code{'("/swapfile")}.
It is possible to specify a swap file in a file system on a mapped

@item @code{skeletons} (default: @code{(default-skeletons)})
A list target file name/file-like object tuples (@pxref{G-Expressions,
file-like objects}).  These are the skeleton files that will be added to
the home directory of newly-created user accounts.

For instance, a valid value may look like this:

@example
`((".bashrc" ,(plain-file "bashrc" "echo Hello\n"))
  (".guile" ,(plain-file "guile"
                         "(use-modules (ice-9 readline))
                          (activate-readline)")))
@end example

@item @code{issue} (default: @var{%default-issue})

The default set includes core utilities and it is good practice to
install non-core utilities in user profiles (@pxref{Invoking guix
package}).

@item @code{timezone}
A timezone identifying string---e.g., @code{"Europe/Paris"}.

You can run the @command{tzselect} command to find out which timezone
string corresponds to your region.  Choosing an invalid timezone name
causes @command{guix system} to fail.

@item @code{locale} (default: @code{"en_US.utf8"})

@item @code{pam-services} (default: @code{(base-pam-services)})
@cindex PAM
@cindex pluggable authentication modules
Linux @dfn{pluggable authentication module} (PAM) services.
@c FIXME: Add xref to PAM services section.

@item @code{setuid-programs} (default: @var{%setuid-programs})
List of string-valued G-expressions denoting setuid programs.
@xref{Setuid Programs}.

@item @code{sudoers-file} (default: @var{%sudoers-specification})
@cindex sudoers file
The contents of the @file{/etc/sudoers} file as a file-like object
(@pxref{G-Expressions, @code{local-file} and @code{plain-file}}).

is that only @code{root} and members of the @code{wheel} group may use
@code{sudo}.

@end table
@end deftp

@node File Systems
@section File Systems

The list of file systems to be mounted is specified in the
@code{file-systems} field of the operating system declaration
(@pxref{Using the Configuration System}).  Each file system is declared
using the @code{file-system} form, like this:

@example
(file-system
  (mount-point "/home")
  (device "/dev/sda3")
  (type "ext4"))
@end example

As usual, some of the fields are mandatory---those shown in the example
above---while others can be omitted.  These are described below.

@deftp {Data Type} file-system
Objects of this type represent file systems to be mounted.  They
contain the following members:

@table @asis
@item @code{type}
This is a string specifying the type of the file system---e.g.,
@code{"ext4"}.

@item @code{mount-point}
This designates the place where the file system is to be mounted.

@item @code{device}
This names the ``source'' of the file system.  It can be one of three
things: a file system label, a file system UUID, or the name of a
@file{/dev} node.  Labels and UUIDs offer a way to refer to file
systems without having to hard-code their actual device
name@footnote{Note that, while it is tempting to use
@file{/dev/disk/by-uuid} and similar device names to achieve the same
result, this is not recommended: These special device nodes are created
by the udev daemon and may be unavailable at the time the device is
mounted.}.

@findex file-system-label
File system labels are created using the @code{file-system-label}
procedure, UUIDs are created using @code{uuid}, and @file{/dev} node are
plain strings.  Here's an example of a file system referred to by its
label, as shown by the @command{e2label} command:

@example
(file-system
  (mount-point "/home")
  (type "ext4")
  (device (file-system-label "my-home")))
@end example

@findex uuid
UUIDs are converted from their string representation (as shown by the
@command{tune2fs -l} command) using the @code{uuid} form@footnote{The
@code{uuid} form expects 16-byte UUIDs as defined in
@uref{https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122, RFC@tie{}4122}.  This is the
form of UUID used by the ext2 family of file systems and others, but it
is different from ``UUIDs'' found in FAT file systems, for instance.},
like this:

@example
(file-system
  (mount-point "/home")
  (type "ext4")
  (device (uuid "4dab5feb-d176-45de-b287-9b0a6e4c01cb")))
@end example

When the source of a file system is a mapped device (@pxref{Mapped
Devices}), its @code{device} field @emph{must} refer to the mapped
device name---e.g., @file{"/dev/mapper/root-partition"}.
This is required so that
the system knows that mounting the file system depends on having the
corresponding device mapping established.

@item @code{flags} (default: @code{'()})
This is a list of symbols denoting mount flags.  Recognized flags
include @code{read-only}, @code{bind-mount}, @code{no-dev} (disallow
access to special files), @code{no-suid} (ignore setuid and setgid
bits), and @code{no-exec} (disallow program execution.)

@item @code{options} (default: @code{#f})
This is either @code{#f}, or a string denoting mount options.

@item @code{mount?} (default: @code{#t})
This value indicates whether to automatically mount the file system when
the system is brought up.  When set to @code{#f}, the file system gets
an entry in @file{/etc/fstab} (read by the @command{mount} command) but
is not automatically mounted.

@item @code{needed-for-boot?} (default: @code{#f})
This Boolean value indicates whether the file system is needed when
booting.  If that is true, then the file system is mounted when the
initial RAM disk (initrd) is loaded.  This is always the case, for
instance, for the root file system.

@item @code{check?} (default: @code{#t})
This Boolean indicates whether the file system needs to be checked for
errors before being mounted.

@item @code{create-mount-point?} (default: @code{#f})
When true, the mount point is created if it does not exist yet.

@item @code{dependencies} (default: @code{'()})
This is a list of @code{<file-system>} or @code{<mapped-device>} objects
representing file systems that must be mounted or mapped devices that
must be opened before (and unmounted or closed after) this one.

As an example, consider a hierarchy of mounts: @file{/sys/fs/cgroup} is
a dependency of @file{/sys/fs/cgroup/cpu} and
@file{/sys/fs/cgroup/memory}.

Another example is a file system that depends on a mapped device, for
example for an encrypted partition (@pxref{Mapped Devices}).
@end table
@end deftp

The @code{(gnu system file-systems)} exports the following useful
variables.

@defvr {Scheme Variable} %base-file-systems
These are essential file systems that are required on normal systems,
such as @var{%pseudo-terminal-file-system} and @var{%immutable-store} (see
below.)  Operating system declarations should always contain at least
these.
@end defvr

@defvr {Scheme Variable} %pseudo-terminal-file-system
This is the file system to be mounted as @file{/dev/pts}.  It supports
@dfn{pseudo-terminals} created @i{via} @code{openpty} and similar
functions (@pxref{Pseudo-Terminals,,, libc, The GNU C Library Reference
Manual}).  Pseudo-terminals are used by terminal emulators such as
@command{xterm}.
@end defvr

@defvr {Scheme Variable} %shared-memory-file-system
This file system is mounted as @file{/dev/shm} and is used to support
memory sharing across processes (@pxref{Memory-mapped I/O,
@code{shm_open},, libc, The GNU C Library Reference Manual}).
@end defvr

@defvr {Scheme Variable} %immutable-store
This file system performs a read-only ``bind mount'' of
@file{/gnu/store}, making it read-only for all the users including
@code{root}.  This prevents against accidental modification by software
running as @code{root} or by system administrators.

The daemon itself is still able to write to the store: it remounts it
read-write in its own ``name space.''
@end defvr

@defvr {Scheme Variable} %binary-format-file-system
The @code{binfmt_misc} file system, which allows handling of arbitrary
executable file types to be delegated to user space.  This requires the
@code{binfmt.ko} kernel module to be loaded.
@end defvr

@defvr {Scheme Variable} %fuse-control-file-system
The @code{fusectl} file system, which allows unprivileged users to mount
and unmount user-space FUSE file systems.  This requires the
@code{fuse.ko} kernel module to be loaded.
@end defvr

@node Mapped Devices
@section Mapped Devices

@cindex device mapping
@cindex mapped devices
The Linux kernel has a notion of @dfn{device mapping}: a block device,
such as a hard disk partition, can be @dfn{mapped} into another device,
usually in @code{/dev/mapper/},
with additional processing over the data that flows through
it@footnote{Note that the GNU@tie{}Hurd makes no difference between the
concept of a ``mapped device'' and that of a file system: both boil down
to @emph{translating} input/output operations made on a file to
operations on its backing store.  Thus, the Hurd implements mapped
devices, like file systems, using the generic @dfn{translator} mechanism
(@pxref{Translators,,, hurd, The GNU Hurd Reference Manual}).}.  A
typical example is encryption device mapping: all writes to the mapped
device are encrypted, and all reads are deciphered, transparently.
Guix extends this notion by considering any device or set of devices that
are @dfn{transformed} in some way to create a new device; for instance,
RAID devices are obtained by @dfn{assembling} several other devices, such
as hard disks or partitions, into a new one that behaves as one partition.
Other examples, not yet implemented, are LVM logical volumes.

Mapped devices are declared using the @code{mapped-device} form,
defined as follows; for examples, see below.

@deftp {Data Type} mapped-device
Objects of this type represent device mappings that will be made when
the system boots up.

@table @code
@item source
This is either a string specifying the name of the block device to be mapped,
such as @code{"/dev/sda3"}, or a list of such strings when several devices
need to be assembled for creating a new one.

@item target
This string specifies the name of the resulting mapped device.  For
kernel mappers such as encrypted devices of type @code{luks-device-mapping},
specifying @code{"my-partition"} leads to the creation of
the @code{"/dev/mapper/my-partition"} device.
For RAID devices of type @code{raid-device-mapping}, the full device name
such as @code{"/dev/md0"} needs to be given.

@item type
This must be a @code{mapped-device-kind} object, which specifies how
@var{source} is mapped to @var{target}.
@end table
@end deftp

@defvr {Scheme Variable} luks-device-mapping
This defines LUKS block device encryption using the @command{cryptsetup}
command from the package with the same name.  It relies on the
@code{dm-crypt} Linux kernel module.
@end defvr

@defvr {Scheme Variable} raid-device-mapping
This defines a RAID device, which is assembled using the @code{mdadm}
command from the package with the same name.  It requires a Linux kernel
module for the appropriate RAID level to be loaded, such as @code{raid456}
for RAID-4, RAID-5 or RAID-6, or @code{raid10} for RAID-10.
@end defvr

@cindex disk encryption
@cindex LUKS
The following example specifies a mapping from @file{/dev/sda3} to
@file{/dev/mapper/home} using LUKS---the
@url{https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup,Linux Unified Key Setup}, a
standard mechanism for disk encryption.
The @file{/dev/mapper/home}
device can then be used as the @code{device} of a @code{file-system}
declaration (@pxref{File Systems}).

@example
(mapped-device
  (source "/dev/sda3")
  (target "home")
  (type luks-device-mapping))
@end example

Alternatively, to become independent of device numbering, one may obtain
the LUKS UUID (@dfn{unique identifier}) of the source device by a
command like:

@example
cryptsetup luksUUID /dev/sda3
@end example

and use it as follows:

@example
(mapped-device
  (source (uuid "cb67fc72-0d54-4c88-9d4b-b225f30b0f44"))
  (target "home")
  (type luks-device-mapping))
@end example

@cindex swap encryption
It is also desirable to encrypt swap space, since swap space may contain
sensitive data.  One way to accomplish that is to use a swap file in a
file system on a device mapped via LUKS encryption.  In this way, the
swap file is encrypted because the entire device is encrypted.
@xref{Preparing for Installation,,Disk Partitioning}, for an example.

A RAID device formed of the partitions @file{/dev/sda1} and @file{/dev/sdb1}
may be declared as follows:

@example
(mapped-device
  (source (list "/dev/sda1" "/dev/sdb1"))
  (target "/dev/md0")
  (type raid-device-mapping))
@end example

The @file{/dev/md0} device can then be used as the @code{device} of a
@code{file-system} declaration (@pxref{File Systems}).
Note that the RAID level need not be given; it is chosen during the
initial creation and formatting of the RAID device and is determined
automatically later.


@node User Accounts
@section User Accounts

@cindex users
@cindex accounts
@cindex user accounts
User accounts and groups are entirely managed through the
@code{operating-system} declaration.  They are specified with the
@code{user-account} and @code{user-group} forms:

@example
(user-account
  (name "alice")
  (group "users")
  (supplementary-groups '("wheel"   ;allow use of sudo, etc.
                          "audio"   ;sound card
                          "video"   ;video devices such as webcams
                          "cdrom")) ;the good ol' CD-ROM
  (comment "Bob's sister")
  (home-directory "/home/alice"))
@end example

When booting or upon completion of @command{guix system reconfigure},
the system ensures that only the user accounts and groups specified in
the @code{operating-system} declaration exist, and with the specified
properties.  Thus, account or group creations or modifications made by
directly invoking commands such as @command{useradd} are lost upon
reconfiguration or reboot.  This ensures that the system remains exactly
as declared.

@deftp {Data Type} user-account
Objects of this type represent user accounts.  The following members may
be specified:

@table @asis
@item @code{name}
The name of the user account.

@item @code{group}
@cindex groups
This is the name (a string) or identifier (a number) of the user group
this account belongs to.

@item @code{supplementary-groups} (default: @code{'()})
Optionally, this can be defined as a list of group names that this
account belongs to.

@item @code{uid} (default: @code{#f})
This is the user ID for this account (a number), or @code{#f}.  In the
latter case, a number is automatically chosen by the system when the
account is created.

@item @code{comment} (default: @code{""})
A comment about the account, such as the account owner's full name.

@item @code{home-directory}
This is the name of the home directory for the account.

@item @code{create-home-directory?} (default: @code{#t})
Indicates whether the home directory of this account should be created
if it does not exist yet.

@item @code{shell} (default: Bash)
This is a G-expression denoting the file name of a program to be used as
the shell (@pxref{G-Expressions}).

@item @code{system?} (default: @code{#f})
This Boolean value indicates whether the account is a ``system''
account.  System accounts are sometimes treated specially; for instance,
graphical login managers do not list them.

@anchor{user-account-password}
@cindex password, for user accounts
@item @code{password} (default: @code{#f})
You would normally leave this field to @code{#f}, initialize user
passwords as @code{root} with the @command{passwd} command, and then let
users change it with @command{passwd}.  Passwords set with
@command{passwd} are of course preserved across reboot and
reconfiguration.

If you @emph{do} want to set an initial password for an account, then
this field must contain the encrypted password, as a string.  You can use the
@code{crypt} procedure for this purpose:

@example
(user-account
  (name "charlie")
  (group "users")

  ;; Specify a SHA-512-hashed initial password.
  (password (crypt "InitialPassword!" "$6$abc")))
@end example

@quotation Note
The hash of this initial password will be available in a file in
@file{/gnu/store}, readable by all the users, so this method must be used with
care.
@end quotation

@xref{Passphrase Storage,,, libc, The GNU C Library Reference Manual}, for
more information on password encryption, and @ref{Encryption,,, guile, GNU
Guile Reference Manual}, for information on Guile's @code{crypt} procedure.

@end table
@end deftp

@cindex groups
User group declarations are even simpler:

@example
(user-group (name "students"))
@end example

@deftp {Data Type} user-group
This type is for, well, user groups.  There are just a few fields:

@table @asis
@item @code{name}
The name of the group.

@item @code{id} (default: @code{#f})
The group identifier (a number).  If @code{#f}, a new number is
automatically allocated when the group is created.

@item @code{system?} (default: @code{#f})
This Boolean value indicates whether the group is a ``system'' group.
System groups have low numerical IDs.

@item @code{password} (default: @code{#f})
What, user groups can have a password?  Well, apparently yes.  Unless
@code{#f}, this field specifies the password of the group.

@end table
@end deftp

For convenience, a variable lists all the basic user groups one may
expect:

@defvr {Scheme Variable} %base-groups
This is the list of basic user groups that users and/or packages expect
to be present on the system.  This includes groups such as ``root'',
``wheel'', and ``users'', as well as groups used to control access to
specific devices such as ``audio'', ``disk'', and ``cdrom''.
@end defvr

@defvr {Scheme Variable} %base-user-accounts
This is the list of basic system accounts that programs may expect to
find on a GNU/Linux system, such as the ``nobody'' account.

Note that the ``root'' account is not included here.  It is a
special-case and is automatically added whether or not it is specified.
@end defvr

@node Keyboard Layout
@section Keyboard Layout

@cindex keyboard layout
@cindex keymap
To specify what each key of your keyboard does, you need to tell the operating
system what @dfn{keyboard layout} you want to use.  The default, when nothing
is specified, is the US English QWERTY layout for 105-key PC keyboards.
However, German speakers will usually prefer the German QWERTZ layout, French
speakers will want the AZERTY layout, and so on; hackers might prefer Dvorak
or bépo, and they might even want to further customize the effect of some of
the keys.  This section explains how to get that done.

@cindex keyboard layout, definition
There are three components that will want to know about your keyboard layout:

@itemize
@item
The @emph{bootloader} may want to know what keyboard layout you want to use
(@pxref{Bootloader Configuration, @code{keyboard-layout}}).  This is useful if
you want, for instance, to make sure that you can type the passphrase of your
encrypted root partition using the right layout.

@item
The @emph{operating system kernel}, Linux, will need that so that the console
is properly configured (@pxref{operating-system Reference,
@code{keyboard-layout}}).

@item
The @emph{graphical display server}, usually Xorg, also has its own idea of
the keyboard layout (@pxref{X Window, @code{keyboard-layout}}).
@end itemize

Guix allows you to configure all three separately but, fortunately, it allows
you to share the same keyboard layout for all three components.

@cindex XKB, keyboard layouts
Keyboard layouts are represented by records created by the
@code{keyboard-layout} procedure of @code{(gnu system keyboard)}.  Following
the X Keyboard extension (XKB), each layout has four attributes: a name (often
a language code such as ``fi'' for Finnish or ``jp'' for Japanese), an
optional variant name, an optional keyboard model name, and a possibly empty
list of additional options.  In most cases the layout name is all you care
about.  Here are a few example:

@example
;; The German QWERTZ layout.  Here we assume a standard
;; "pc105" keyboard model.
(keyboard-layout "de")

;; The bépo variant of the French layout.
(keyboard-layout "fr" "bepo")

;; The Catalan layout.
(keyboard-layout "es" "cat")

;; The Latin American Spanish layout.  In addition, the
;; "Caps Lock" key is used as an additional "Ctrl" key,
;; and the "Menu" key is used as a "Compose" key to enter
;; accented letters.
(keyboard-layout "latam"
                 #:options '("ctrl:nocaps" "compose:menu"))

;; The Russian layout for a ThinkPad keyboard.
(keyboard-layout "ru" #:model "thinkpad")

;; The "US international" layout, which is the US layout plus
;; dead keys to enter accented characters.  This is for an
;; Apple MacBook keyboard.
(keyboard-layout "us" "intl" #:model "macbook78")
@end example

See the @file{share/X11/xkb} directory of the @code{xkeyboard-config} package
for a complete list of supported layouts, variants, and models.

@cindex keyboard layout, configuration
Let's say you want your system to use the Turkish keyboard layout throughout
your system---bootloader, console, and Xorg.  Here's what your system
configuration would look like:

@findex set-xorg-configuration
@lisp
;; Using the Turkish layout for the bootloader, the console,
;; and for Xorg.

(operating-system
  ;; ...
  (keyboard-layout (keyboard-layout "tr"))  ;for the console
  (bootloader (bootloader-configuration
                (bootloader grub-efi-bootloader)
                (target "/boot/efi")
                (keyboard-layout keyboard-layout))) ;for GRUB
  (services (cons (set-xorg-configuration
                    (xorg-configuration             ;for Xorg
                      (keyboard-layout keyboard-layout)))
                  %desktop-services)))
@end lisp

In the example above, for GRUB and for Xorg, we just refer to the
@code{keyboard-layout} field defined above, but we could just as well refer to
a different layout.  The @code{set-xorg-configuration} procedure communicates
the desired Xorg configuration to the graphical log-in manager, by default
GDM.

We've discussed how to specify the @emph{default} keyboard layout of your
system when it starts, but you can also adjust it at run time:

@itemize
@item
If you're using GNOME, its settings panel has a ``Region & Language'' entry
where you can select one or more keyboard layouts.

@item
Under Xorg, the @command{setxkbmap} command (from the same-named package)
allows you to change the current layout.  For example, this is how you would
change the layout to US Dvorak:

@example
setxkbmap us dvorak
@end example

@item
The @code{loadkeys} command changes the keyboard layout in effect in the Linux
console.  However, note that @code{loadkeys} does @emph{not} use the XKB
keyboard layout categorization described above.  The command below loads the
French bépo layout:

@example
loadkeys fr-bepo
@end example
@end itemize

@node Locales
@section Locales

@cindex locale
A @dfn{locale} defines cultural conventions for a particular language
and region of the world (@pxref{Locales,,, libc, The GNU C Library
Reference Manual}).  Each locale has a name that typically has the form
@code{@var{language}_@var{territory}.@var{codeset}}---e.g.,
@code{fr_LU.utf8} designates the locale for the French language, with
cultural conventions from Luxembourg, and using the UTF-8 encoding.

@cindex locale definition
Usually, you will want to specify the default locale for the machine
using the @code{locale} field of the @code{operating-system} declaration
(@pxref{operating-system Reference, @code{locale}}).

The selected locale is automatically added to the @dfn{locale
definitions} known to the system if needed, with its codeset inferred
from its name---e.g., @code{bo_CN.utf8} will be assumed to use the
@code{UTF-8} codeset.  Additional locale definitions can be specified in
the @code{locale-definitions} slot of @code{operating-system}---this is
useful, for instance, if the codeset could not be inferred from the
locale name.  The default set of locale definitions includes some widely
used locales, but not all the available locales, in order to save space.

For instance, to add the North Frisian locale for Germany, the value of
that field may be:

@example
(cons (locale-definition
        (name "fy_DE.utf8") (source "fy_DE"))
      %default-locale-definitions)
@end example

Likewise, to save space, one might want @code{locale-definitions} to
list only the locales that are actually used, as in:

@example
(list (locale-definition
        (name "ja_JP.eucjp") (source "ja_JP")
        (charset "EUC-JP")))
@end example

@vindex LOCPATH
The compiled locale definitions are available at
@file{/run/current-system/locale/X.Y}, where @code{X.Y} is the libc
version, which is the default location where the GNU@tie{}libc provided
by Guix looks for locale data.  This can be overridden using the
@code{LOCPATH} environment variable (@pxref{locales-and-locpath,
@code{LOCPATH} and locale packages}).

The @code{locale-definition} form is provided by the @code{(gnu system
locale)} module.  Details are given below.

@deftp {Data Type} locale-definition
This is the data type of a locale definition.

@table @asis

@item @code{name}
The name of the locale.  @xref{Locale Names,,, libc, The GNU C Library
Reference Manual}, for more information on locale names.

@item @code{source}
The name of the source for that locale.  This is typically the
@code{@var{language}_@var{territory}} part of the locale name.

@item @code{charset} (default: @code{"UTF-8"})
The ``character set'' or ``code set'' for that locale,
@uref{http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets, as defined by
IANA}.

@end table
@end deftp

@defvr {Scheme Variable} %default-locale-definitions
A list of commonly used UTF-8 locales, used as the default
value of the @code{locale-definitions} field of @code{operating-system}
declarations.

@cindex locale name
@cindex normalized codeset in locale names
These locale definitions use the @dfn{normalized codeset} for the part
that follows the dot in the name (@pxref{Using gettextized software,
normalized codeset,, libc, The GNU C Library Reference Manual}).  So for
instance it has @code{uk_UA.utf8} but @emph{not}, say,
@code{uk_UA.UTF-8}.
@end defvr

@subsection Locale Data Compatibility Considerations

@cindex incompatibility, of locale data
@code{operating-system} declarations provide a @code{locale-libcs} field
to specify the GNU@tie{}libc packages that are used to compile locale
declarations (@pxref{operating-system Reference}).  ``Why would I
care?'', you may ask.  Well, it turns out that the binary format of
locale data is occasionally incompatible from one libc version to
another.

@c See <https://sourceware.org/ml/libc-alpha/2015-09/msg00575.html>
@c and <https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/guix-devel/2015-08/msg00737.html>.
For instance, a program linked against libc version 2.21 is unable to
read locale data produced with libc 2.22; worse, that program
@emph{aborts} instead of simply ignoring the incompatible locale
data@footnote{Versions 2.23 and later of GNU@tie{}libc will simply skip
the incompatible locale data, which is already an improvement.}.
Similarly, a program linked against libc 2.22 can read most, but not
all, of the locale data from libc 2.21 (specifically, @code{LC_COLLATE}
data is incompatible); thus calls to @code{setlocale} may fail, but
programs will not abort.

The ``problem'' with Guix is that users have a lot of freedom: They can
choose whether and when to upgrade software in their profiles, and might
be using a libc version different from the one the system administrator
used to build the system-wide locale data.

Fortunately, unprivileged users can also install their own locale data
and define @var{GUIX_LOCPATH} accordingly (@pxref{locales-and-locpath,
@code{GUIX_LOCPATH} and locale packages}).

Still, it is best if the system-wide locale data at
@file{/run/current-system/locale} is built for all the libc versions
actually in use on the system, so that all the programs can access
it---this is especially crucial on a multi-user system.  To do that, the
administrator can specify several libc packages in the
@code{locale-libcs} field of @code{operating-system}:

@example
(use-package-modules base)

(operating-system
  ;; @dots{}
  (locale-libcs (list glibc-2.21 (canonical-package glibc))))
@end example

This example would lead to a system containing locale definitions for
both libc 2.21 and the current version of libc in
@file{/run/current-system/locale}.


@node Services
@section Services

@cindex system services
An important part of preparing an @code{operating-system} declaration is
listing @dfn{system services} and their configuration (@pxref{Using the
Configuration System}).  System services are typically daemons launched
when the system boots, or other actions needed at that time---e.g.,
configuring network access.

Guix has a broad definition of ``service'' (@pxref{Service
Composition}), but many services are managed by the GNU@tie{}Shepherd
(@pxref{Shepherd Services}).  On a running system, the @command{herd}
command allows you to list the available services, show their status,
start and stop them, or do other specific operations (@pxref{Jump
Start,,, shepherd, The GNU Shepherd Manual}).  For example:

@example
# herd status
@end example

The above command, run as @code{root}, lists the currently defined
services.  The @command{herd doc} command shows a synopsis of the given
service and its associated actions:

@example
# herd doc nscd
Run libc's name service cache daemon (nscd).

# herd doc nscd action invalidate
invalidate: Invalidate the given cache--e.g., 'hosts' for host name lookups.
@end example

The @command{start}, @command{stop}, and @command{restart} sub-commands
have the effect you would expect.  For instance, the commands below stop
the nscd service and restart the Xorg display server:

@example
# herd stop nscd
Service nscd has been stopped.
# herd restart xorg-server
Service xorg-server has been stopped.
Service xorg-server has been started.
@end example

The following sections document the available services, starting with
the core services, that may be used in an @code{operating-system}
declaration.

@menu

@node Base Services
@subsection Base Services

The @code{(gnu services base)} module provides definitions for the basic
services that one expects from the system.  The services exported by
this module are listed below.

@defvr {Scheme Variable} %base-services
This variable contains a list of basic services (@pxref{Service Types
and Services}, for more information on service objects) one would
expect from the system: a login service (mingetty) on each tty, syslogd,
the libc name service cache daemon (nscd), the udev device manager, and
more.

This is the default value of the @code{services} field of
@code{operating-system} declarations.  Usually, when customizing a
system, you will want to append services to @var{%base-services}, like
this:

@example
(append (list (service avahi-service-type)
              (service openssh-service-type))
        %base-services)
@end example
@end defvr

@defvr {Scheme Variable} special-files-service-type
This is the service that sets up ``special files'' such as
@file{/bin/sh}; an instance of it is part of @code{%base-services}.

The value associated with @code{special-files-service-type} services
must be a list of tuples where the first element is the ``special file''
and the second element is its target.  By default it is:

@cindex @file{/bin/sh}
@cindex @file{sh}, in @file{/bin}
@example
`(("/bin/sh" ,(file-append @var{bash} "/bin/sh")))
@end example

@cindex @file{/usr/bin/env}
@cindex @file{env}, in @file{/usr/bin}
If you want to add, say, @code{/usr/bin/env} to your system, you can
change it to:

@example
`(("/bin/sh" ,(file-append @var{bash} "/bin/sh"))
  ("/usr/bin/env" ,(file-append @var{coreutils} "/bin/env")))
@end example

Since this is part of @code{%base-services}, you can use
@code{modify-services} to customize the set of special files
(@pxref{Service Reference, @code{modify-services}}).  But the simple way
to add a special file is @i{via} the @code{extra-special-file} procedure
(see below.)
@end defvr

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} extra-special-file @var{file} @var{target}
Use @var{target} as the ``special file'' @var{file}.

For example, adding the following lines to the @code{services} field of
your operating system declaration leads to a @file{/usr/bin/env}
symlink:

@example
(extra-special-file "/usr/bin/env"
                    (file-append coreutils "/bin/env"))
@end example
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} host-name-service @var{name}
Return a service that sets the host name to @var{name}.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} login-service @var{config}
Return a service to run login according to @var{config}, a
@code{<login-configuration>} object, which specifies the message of the day,
among other things.
@end deffn

@deftp {Data Type} login-configuration
This is the data type representing the configuration of login.

@table @asis

@item @code{motd}
@cindex message of the day
A file-like object containing the ``message of the day''.

@item @code{allow-empty-passwords?} (default: @code{#t})
Allow empty passwords by default so that first-time users can log in when
the 'root' account has just been created.

@end table
@end deftp

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} mingetty-service @var{config}
Return a service to run mingetty according to @var{config}, a
@code{<mingetty-configuration>} object, which specifies the tty to run, among
other things.
@end deffn

@deftp {Data Type} mingetty-configuration
This is the data type representing the configuration of Mingetty, which
provides the default implementation of virtual console log-in.

@table @asis

@item @code{tty}
The name of the console this Mingetty runs on---e.g., @code{"tty1"}.

@item @code{auto-login} (default: @code{#f})
When true, this field must be a string denoting the user name under
which the system automatically logs in.  When it is @code{#f}, a
user name and password must be entered to log in.

@item @code{login-program} (default: @code{#f})
This must be either @code{#f}, in which case the default log-in program
is used (@command{login} from the Shadow tool suite), or a gexp denoting
the name of the log-in program.

@item @code{login-pause?} (default: @code{#f})
When set to @code{#t} in conjunction with @var{auto-login}, the user
will have to press a key before the log-in shell is launched.

@item @code{mingetty} (default: @var{mingetty})
The Mingetty package to use.

@end table
@end deftp

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} agetty-service @var{config}
Return a service to run agetty according to @var{config}, an
@code{<agetty-configuration>} object, which specifies the tty to run,
among other things.
@end deffn

@deftp {Data Type} agetty-configuration
This is the data type representing the configuration of agetty, which
implements virtual and serial console log-in.  See the @code{agetty(8)}
man page for more information.

@table @asis

@item @code{tty}
The name of the console this agetty runs on, as a string---e.g.,
@code{"ttyS0"}. This argument is optional, it will default to
a reasonable default serial port used by the kernel Linux.

For this, if there is a value for an option @code{agetty.tty} in the kernel
command line, agetty will extract the device name of the serial port
from it and use that.

If not and if there is a value for an option @code{console} with a tty in
the Linux command line, agetty will extract the device name of the
serial port from it and use that.

In both cases, agetty will leave the other serial device settings
(baud rate etc.)@: alone---in the hope that Linux pinned them to the
correct values.

@item @code{baud-rate} (default: @code{#f})
A string containing a comma-separated list of one or more baud rates, in
descending order.

@item @code{term} (default: @code{#f})
A string containing the value used for the @code{TERM} environment
variable.

@item @code{eight-bits?} (default: @code{#f})
When @code{#t}, the tty is assumed to be 8-bit clean, and parity detection is
disabled.

@item @code{auto-login} (default: @code{#f})
When passed a login name, as a string, the specified user will be logged
in automatically without prompting for their login name or password.

@item @code{no-reset?} (default: @code{#f})
When @code{#t}, don't reset terminal cflags (control modes).

@item @code{host} (default: @code{#f})
This accepts a string containing the "login_host", which will be written
into the @file{/var/run/utmpx} file.

@item @code{remote?} (default: @code{#f})
When set to @code{#t} in conjunction with @var{host}, this will add an
@code{-r} fakehost option to the command line of the login program
specified in @var{login-program}.

@item @code{flow-control?} (default: @code{#f})
When set to @code{#t}, enable hardware (RTS/CTS) flow control.

@item @code{no-issue?} (default: @code{#f})
When set to @code{#t}, the contents of the @file{/etc/issue} file will
not be displayed before presenting the login prompt.

@item @code{init-string} (default: @code{#f})
This accepts a string that will be sent to the tty or modem before
sending anything else.  It can be used to initialize a modem.

@item @code{no-clear?} (default: @code{#f})
When set to @code{#t}, agetty will not clear the screen before showing
the login prompt.

@item @code{login-program} (default: (file-append shadow "/bin/login"))
This must be either a gexp denoting the name of a log-in program, or
unset, in which case the default value is the @command{login} from the
Shadow tool suite.

@item @code{local-line} (default: @code{#f})
Control the CLOCAL line flag.  This accepts one of three symbols as
arguments, @code{'auto}, @code{'always}, or @code{'never}. If @code{#f},
the default value chosen by agetty is @code{'auto}.

@item @code{extract-baud?} (default: @code{#f})
When set to @code{#t}, instruct agetty to try to extract the baud rate
from the status messages produced by certain types of modems.

@item @code{skip-login?} (default: @code{#f})
When set to @code{#t}, do not prompt the user for a login name.  This
can be used with @var{login-program} field to use non-standard login
systems.

@item @code{no-newline?} (default: @code{#f})
When set to @code{#t}, do not print a newline before printing the
@file{/etc/issue} file.

@c Is this dangerous only when used with login-program, or always?
@item @code{login-options} (default: @code{#f})
This option accepts a string containing options that are passed to the
login program.  When used with the @var{login-program}, be aware that a
malicious user could try to enter a login name containing embedded
options that could be parsed by the login program.

@item @code{login-pause} (default: @code{#f})
When set to @code{#t}, wait for any key before showing the login prompt.
This can be used in conjunction with @var{auto-login} to save memory by
lazily spawning shells.

@item @code{chroot} (default: @code{#f})
Change root to the specified directory.  This option accepts a directory
path as a string.

@item @code{hangup?} (default: @code{#f})
Use the Linux system call @code{vhangup} to do a virtual hangup of the
specified terminal.

@item @code{keep-baud?} (default: @code{#f})
When set to @code{#t}, try to keep the existing baud rate.  The baud
rates from @var{baud-rate} are used when agetty receives a @key{BREAK}
character.

@item @code{timeout} (default: @code{#f})
When set to an integer value, terminate if no user name could be read
within @var{timeout} seconds.

@item @code{detect-case?} (default: @code{#f})
When set to @code{#t}, turn on support for detecting an uppercase-only
terminal.  This setting will detect a login name containing only
uppercase letters as indicating an uppercase-only terminal and turn on
some upper-to-lower case conversions.  Note that this will not support
Unicode characters.

@item @code{wait-cr?} (default: @code{#f})
When set to @code{#t}, wait for the user or modem to send a
carriage-return or linefeed character before displaying
@file{/etc/issue} or login prompt.  This is typically used with the
@var{init-string} option.

@item @code{no-hints?} (default: @code{#f})
When set to @code{#t}, do not print hints about Num, Caps, and Scroll
locks.

@item @code{no-hostname?} (default: @code{#f})
By default, the hostname is printed.  When this option is set to
@code{#t}, no hostname will be shown at all.

@item @code{long-hostname?} (default: @code{#f})
By default, the hostname is only printed until the first dot.  When this
option is set to @code{#t}, the fully qualified hostname by
@code{gethostname} or @code{getaddrinfo} is shown.

@item @code{erase-characters} (default: @code{#f})
This option accepts a string of additional characters that should be
interpreted as backspace when the user types their login name.

@item @code{kill-characters} (default: @code{#f})
This option accepts a string that should be interpreted to mean "ignore
all previous characters" (also called a "kill" character) when the types
their login name.

@item @code{chdir} (default: @code{#f})
This option accepts, as a string, a directory path that will be changed
to before login.

@item @code{delay} (default: @code{#f})
This options accepts, as an integer, the number of seconds to sleep
before opening the tty and displaying the login prompt.

@item @code{nice} (default: @code{#f})
This option accepts, as an integer, the nice value with which to run the
@command{login} program.

@item @code{extra-options} (default: @code{'()})
This option provides an "escape hatch" for the user to provide arbitrary
command-line arguments to @command{agetty} as a list of strings.

Package object denoting the GNU C Library providing the @command{nscd}
command.

@item @code{log-file} (default: @code{"/var/log/nscd.log"})
Name of the nscd log file.  This is where debugging output goes when
@code{debug-level} is strictly positive.

@deftp {Data Type} nscd-cache
Data type representing a cache database of nscd and its parameters.

@table @asis

@item @code{database}
This is a symbol representing the name of the database to be cached.
Valid values are @code{passwd}, @code{group}, @code{hosts}, and
@code{services}, which designate the corresponding NSS database
(@pxref{NSS Basics,,, libc, The GNU C Library Reference Manual}).

@item @code{positive-time-to-live}
@itemx @code{negative-time-to-live} (default: @code{20})
A number representing the number of seconds during which a positive or
negative lookup result remains in cache.

@item @code{check-files?} (default: @code{#t})
Whether to check for updates of the files corresponding to
@var{database}.

For instance, when @var{database} is @code{hosts}, setting this flag
instructs nscd to check for updates in @file{/etc/hosts} and to take
them into account.

@item @code{persistent?} (default: @code{#t})
Whether the cache should be stored persistently on disk.

@item @code{shared?} (default: @code{#t})
Whether the cache should be shared among users.

@item @code{max-database-size} (default: 32@tie{}MiB)
Maximum size in bytes of the database cache.

@c XXX: 'suggested-size' and 'auto-propagate?' seem to be expert

@defvr {Scheme Variable} %nscd-default-caches
List of @code{<nscd-cache>} objects used by default by
@code{nscd-configuration} (see above).

It enables persistent and aggressive caching of service and host name
lookups.  The latter provides better host name lookup performance,
resilience in the face of unreliable name servers, and also better
privacy---often the result of host name lookups is in local cache, so
external name servers do not even need to be queried.

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} udev-service [#:udev @var{eudev} #:rules @code{'()}]
Run @var{udev}, which populates the @file{/dev} directory dynamically.
udev rules can be provided as a list of files through the @var{rules}
variable.  The procedures @var{udev-rule} and @var{file->udev-rule} from
@code{(gnu services base)} simplify the creation of such rule files.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} udev-rule [@var{file-name} @var{contents}]
Return a udev-rule file named @var{file-name} containing the rules
defined by the @var{contents} literal.

In the following example, a rule for a USB device is defined to be
stored in the file @file{90-usb-thing.rules}.  The rule runs a script
upon detecting a USB device with a given product identifier.

@example
(define %example-udev-rule
  (udev-rule
    "90-usb-thing.rules"
    (string-append "ACTION==\"add\", SUBSYSTEM==\"usb\", "
                   "ATTR@{product@}==\"Example\", "
                   "RUN+=\"/path/to/script\"")))
@end example

The @command{herd rules udev} command, as root, returns the name of the
directory containing all the active udev rules.
@end deffn

Here we show how the default @var{udev-service} can be extended with it.

@example
(operating-system
 ;; @dots{}
 (services
 (modify-services %desktop-services
   (udev-service-type config =>
     (udev-configuration (inherit config)
      (rules (append (udev-configuration-rules config)
                     (list %example-udev-rule))))))))
@end example

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} file->udev-rule [@var{file-name} @var{file}]
Return a udev file named @var{file-name} containing the rules defined
within @var{file}, a file-like object.

The following example showcases how we can use an existing rule file.

@example
(use-modules (guix download)     ;for url-fetch
             (guix packages)     ;for origin
             ;; @dots{})

(define %android-udev-rules
  (file->udev-rule
    "51-android-udev.rules"
    (let ((version "20170910"))
      (origin
       (method url-fetch)
       (uri (string-append "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/M0Rf30/"
                           "android-udev-rules/" version "/51-android.rules"))
       (sha256
        (base32 "0lmmagpyb6xsq6zcr2w1cyx9qmjqmajkvrdbhjx32gqf1d9is003"))))))
@end example
@end deffn

Additionally, Guix package definitions can be included in @var{rules} in
order to extend the udev rules with the definitions found under their
@file{lib/udev/rules.d} sub-directory.  In lieu of the previous
@var{file->udev-rule} example, we could have used the
@var{android-udev-rules} package which exists in Guix in the @code{(gnu
packages android)} module.

The following example shows how to use the @var{android-udev-rules}
package so that the Android tool @command{adb} can detect devices
without root privileges.  It also details how to create the
@code{adbusers} group, which is required for the proper functioning of
the rules defined within the @var{android-udev-rules} package.  To
create such a group, we must define it both as part of the
@var{supplementary-groups} of our @var{user-account} declaration, as
well as in the @var{groups} field of the @var{operating-system} record.

@example
(use-modules (gnu packages android)  ;for android-udev-rules
             (gnu system shadow)     ;for user-group
             ;; @dots{})

                   "wheel" "netdev" "audio" "video"))
                ;; @dots{})))

  (groups (cons (user-group (system? #t) (name "adbusers"))
                %base-groups))

  ;; @dots{}

@item @code{port} (default: @code{80})
The TCP port to listen for connections.

@item @code{host} (default: @code{"localhost"})
The host (and thus, network interface) to listen to.  Use
@code{"0.0.0.0"} to listen on all the network interfaces.

@item @code{compression-level} (default: @code{3})
The gzip compression level at which substitutes are compressed.  Use
@code{0} to disable compression altogether, and @code{9} to get the best
compression ratio at the expense of increased CPU usage.

@item @code{nar-path} (default: @code{"nar"})
The URL path at which ``nars'' can be fetched.  @xref{Invoking guix
publish, @code{--nar-path}}, for details.

@item @code{cache} (default: @code{#f})
When it is @code{#f}, disable caching and instead generate archives on
demand.  Otherwise, this should be the name of a directory---e.g.,
@code{"/var/cache/guix/publish"}---where @command{guix publish} caches
archives and meta-data ready to be sent.  @xref{Invoking guix publish,
@option{--cache}}, for more information on the tradeoffs involved.

@item @code{workers} (default: @code{#f})
When it is an integer, this is the number of worker threads used for
caching; when @code{#f}, the number of processors is used.
@xref{Invoking guix publish, @option{--workers}}, for more information.

@item @code{ttl} (default: @code{#f})

@code{pam_limits} module}.  The procedure optionally takes a list of
@code{pam-limits-entry} values, which can be used to specify
@code{ulimit} limits and nice priority limits to user sessions.

The following limits definition sets two hard and soft limits for all
login sessions of users in the @code{realtime} group:

@example
(pam-limits-service
 (list
  (pam-limits-entry "@@realtime" 'both 'rtprio 99)
  (pam-limits-entry "@@realtime" 'both 'memlock 'unlimited)))
@end example

The first entry increases the maximum realtime priority for
non-privileged processes; the second entry lifts any restriction of the
maximum address space that can be locked in memory.  These settings are
commonly used for real-time audio systems.

@node Scheduled Job Execution
@subsection Scheduled Job Execution

@cindex mcron
@cindex scheduling jobs
The @code{(gnu services mcron)} module provides an interface to
GNU@tie{}mcron, a daemon to run jobs at scheduled times (@pxref{Top,,,
mcron, GNU@tie{}mcron}).  GNU@tie{}mcron is similar to the traditional
Unix @command{cron} daemon; the main difference is that it is
implemented in Guile Scheme, which provides a lot of flexibility when
specifying the scheduling of jobs and their actions.

The example below defines an operating system that runs the
@command{updatedb} (@pxref{Invoking updatedb,,, find, Finding Files})
and the @command{guix gc} commands (@pxref{Invoking guix gc}) daily, as
well as the @command{mkid} command on behalf of an unprivileged user

@subsection Log Rotation

@cindex rottlog
@cindex log rotation
@cindex logging
Log files such as those found in @file{/var/log} tend to grow endlessly,
so it's a good idea to @dfn{rotate} them once in a while---i.e., archive
their contents in separate files, possibly compressed.  The @code{(gnu
services admin)} module provides an interface to GNU@tie{}Rot[t]log, a
log rotation tool (@pxref{Top,,, rottlog, GNU Rot[t]log Manual}).

The example below defines an operating system that provides log rotation
with the default settings, for commonly encountered log files.

specification (@pxref{Scheduled Job Execution}).
@end table
@end deftp

@deftp {Data Type} log-rotation
Data type representing the rotation of a group of log files.

Taking an example from the Rottlog manual (@pxref{Period Related File

defined like this:

@example
(log-rotation
  (frequency 'daily)
  (files '("/var/log/apache/*"))
  (options '("storedir apache-archives"
             "rotate 6"
             "notifempty"
             "nocompress")))
@end example

The list of fields is as follows:

@table @asis
@item @code{frequency} (default: @code{'weekly})
The log rotation frequency, a symbol.

@item @code{files}
The list of files or file glob patterns to rotate.

@item @code{options} (default: @code{'()})
The list of rottlog options for this rotation (@pxref{Configuration

Run the @command{lshd} program from @var{lsh} to listen on port @var{port-number}.
@var{host-key} must designate a file containing the host key, and readable
only by root.

When @var{daemonic?} is true, @command{lshd} will detach from the
controlling terminal and log its output to syslogd, unless one sets
@var{syslog-output?} to false.  Obviously, it also makes lsh-service
depend on existence of syslogd service.  When @var{pid-file?} is true,
@command{lshd} writes its PID to the file called @var{pid-file}.

When @var{initialize?} is true, automatically create the seed and host key
upon service activation if they do not exist yet.  This may take long and
require interaction.

When @var{initialize?} is false, it is up to the user to initialize the
randomness generator (@pxref{lsh-make-seed,,, lsh, LSH Manual}), and to create
a key pair with the private key stored in file @var{host-key} (@pxref{lshd
basics,,, lsh, LSH Manual}).

When @var{interfaces} is empty, lshd listens for connections on all the
network interfaces; otherwise, @var{interfaces} must be a list of host names
or addresses.

@var{allow-empty-passwords?} specifies whether to accept log-ins with empty
passwords, and @var{root-login?} specifies whether to accept log-ins as
root.

The other options should be self-descriptive.

Name of the file where @command{sshd} writes its PID.

@item @code{port-number} (default: @code{22})
TCP port on which @command{sshd} listens for incoming connections.

@item @code{permit-root-login} (default: @code{#f})
This field determines whether and when to allow logins as root.  If
@code{#f}, root logins are disallowed; if @code{#t}, they are allowed.
If it's the symbol @code{'without-password}, then root logins are
permitted but not with password-based authentication.

@item @code{allow-empty-passwords?} (default: @code{#f})
When true, users with empty passwords may log in.  When false, they may
not.

@item @code{password-authentication?} (default: @code{#t})
When true, users may log in with their password.  When false, they have
other authentication methods.

@item @code{public-key-authentication?} (default: @code{#t})

@code{#t}, this will enable PAM authentication using
@code{challenge-response-authentication?} and
@code{password-authentication?}, in addition to PAM account and session
module processing for all authentication types.

Because PAM challenge response authentication usually serves an
equivalent role to password authentication, you should disable either
@code{challenge-response-authentication?} or
@code{password-authentication?}.

@item @code{print-last-log?} (default: @code{#t})
Specifies whether @command{sshd} should print the date and time of the
last user login when a user logs in interactively.

@item @code{subsystems} (default: @code{'(("sftp" "internal-sftp"))})
Configures external subsystems (e.g.@: file transfer daemon).

This is a list of two-element lists, each of which containing the
subsystem name and a command (with optional arguments) to execute upon
subsystem request.

The command @command{internal-sftp} implements an in-process SFTP
server.  Alternately, one can specify the @command{sftp-server} command:
@example
(service openssh-service-type
         (openssh-configuration
          (subsystems
           `(("sftp" ,(file-append openssh "/libexec/sftp-server"))))))
@end example

@item @code{accepted-environment} (default: @code{'()})
List of strings describing which environment variables may be exported.

Each string gets on its own line.  See the @code{AcceptEnv} option in
@code{man sshd_config}.

This example allows ssh-clients to export the @code{COLORTERM} variable.
It is set by terminal emulators, which support colors.  You can use it in
your shell's ressource file to enable colors for the prompt and commands
if this variable is set.

@example
(service openssh-service-type
         (openssh-configuration
           (accepted-environment '("COLORTERM"))))
@end example

@item @code{authorized-keys} (default: @code{'()})
@cindex authorized keys, SSH
@cindex SSH authorized keys
This is the list of authorized keys.  Each element of the list is a user
name followed by one or more file-like objects that represent SSH public
keys.  For example:

@example
(openssh-configuration
  (authorized-keys
    `(("rekado" ,(local-file "rekado.pub"))
      ("chris" ,(local-file "chris.pub"))
      ("root" ,(local-file "rekado.pub") ,(local-file "chris.pub")))))
@end example

@noindent
registers the specified public keys for user accounts @code{rekado},
@code{chris}, and @code{root}.

Additional authorized keys can be specified @i{via}
@code{service-extension}.

Note that this does @emph{not} interfere with the use of
@file{~/.ssh/authorized_keys}.

@item @code{log-level} (default: @code{'info})
This is a symbol specifying the logging level: @code{quiet}, @code{fatal},
@code{error}, @code{info}, @code{verbose}, @code{debug}, etc.  See the man
page for @file{sshd_config} for the full list of level names.

@item @code{extra-content} (default: @code{""})
This field can be used to append arbitrary text to the configuration file.  It
is especially useful for elaborate configurations that cannot be expressed
otherwise.  This configuration, for example, would generally disable root
logins, but permit them from one specific IP address:

@example
(openssh-configuration
  (extra-content "\
Match Address 192.168.0.1
  PermitRootLogin yes"))
@end example

@defvr {Scheme Variable} %facebook-host-aliases
This variable contains a string for use in @file{/etc/hosts}
(@pxref{Host Names,,, libc, The GNU C Library Reference Manual}).  Each
line contains a entry that maps a known server name of the Facebook
on-line service---e.g., @code{www.facebook.com}---to the local
host---@code{127.0.0.1} or its IPv6 equivalent, @code{::1}.

This variable is typically used in the @code{hosts-file} field of an
@code{operating-system} declaration (@pxref{operating-system Reference,
@file{/etc/hosts}}):

@example
(use-modules (gnu) (guix))

(operating-system
  (host-name "mymachine")
  ;; ...
  (hosts-file
    ;; Create a /etc/hosts file with aliases for "localhost"
    ;; and "mymachine", as well as for Facebook servers.
    (plain-file "hosts"
                (string-append (local-host-aliases host-name)
                               %facebook-host-aliases))))

@node X Window
@subsection X Window

@cindex X11
@cindex X Window System
@cindex login manager
Support for the X Window graphical display system---specifically
Xorg---is provided by the @code{(gnu services xorg)} module.  Note that
there is no @code{xorg-service} procedure.  Instead, the X server is
started by the @dfn{login manager}, by default the GNOME Display Manager (GDM).

@cindex GDM
@cindex GNOME, login manager
GDM of course allows users to log in into window managers and desktop
environments other than GNOME; for those using GNOME, GDM is required for
features such as automatic screen locking.

@cindex window manager
To use X11, you must install at least one @dfn{window manager}---for
example the @code{windowmaker} or @code{openbox} packages---preferably
by adding it to the @code{packages} field of your operating system
definition (@pxref{operating-system Reference, system-wide packages}).

@defvr {Scheme Variable} gdm-service-type
This is the type for the @uref{https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/GDM/, GNOME
Desktop Manager} (GDM), a program that manages graphical display servers and
handles graphical user logins.  Its value must be a @code{gdm-configuration}

@cindex session types (X11)
@cindex X11 session types
GDM looks for @dfn{session types} described by the @file{.desktop} files in
@file{/run/current-system/profile/share/xsessions} and allows users to choose
a session from the log-in screen.  Packages such as @code{gnome}, @code{xfce},
and @code{i3} provide @file{.desktop} files; adding them to the system-wide
set of packages automatically makes them available at the log-in screen.

In addition, @file{~/.xsession} files are honored.  When available,
@file{~/.xsession} must be an executable that starts a window manager
and/or other X clients.
@end defvr

@cindex Xorg, configuration
@deftp {Data Type} xorg-configuration
This data type represents the configuration of the Xorg graphical display
server.  Note that there is not Xorg service; instead, the X server is started
by a ``display manager'' such as GDM, SDDM, and SLiM.  Thus, the configuration
of these display managers aggregates an @code{xorg-configuration} record.

@table @asis
@item @code{modules} (default: @code{%default-xorg-modules})
This is a list of @dfn{module packages} loaded by the Xorg
server---e.g., @code{xf86-video-vesa}, @code{xf86-input-keyboard}, and so on.

@item @code{fonts} (default: @code{%default-xorg-fonts})
This is a list of font directories to add to the server's @dfn{font path}.

@item @code{drivers} (default: @code{'()})
This must be either the empty list, in which case Xorg chooses a graphics
driver automatically, or a list of driver names that will be tried in this
order---e.g., @code{("modesetting" "vesa")}.

@item @code{resolutions} (default: @code{'()})
When @code{resolutions} is the empty list, Xorg chooses an appropriate screen
resolution.  Otherwise, it must be a list of resolutions---e.g., @code{((1024
768) (640 480))}.

@cindex keyboard layout, for Xorg
@cindex keymap, for Xorg
@item @code{keyboard-layout} (default: @code{#f})
If this is @code{#f}, Xorg uses the default keyboard layout---usually US
English (``qwerty'') for a 105-key PC keyboard.

Otherwise this must be a @code{keyboard-layout} object specifying the keyboard
layout in use when Xorg is running.  @xref{Keyboard Layout}, for more
information on how to specify the keyboard layout.

@item @code{extra-config} (default: @code{'()})

  [@var{login-manager-service-type}]
Tell the log-in manager (of type @var{login-manager-service-type}) to use
@var{config}, an <xorg-configuration> record.

Since the Xorg configuration is embedded in the log-in manager's
configuration---e.g., @code{gdm-configuration}---this procedure provides a
shorthand to set the Xorg configuration.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} xorg-start-command [@var{config}]
Return a @code{startx} script in which the modules, fonts, etc. specified

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} screen-locker-service @var{package} [@var{program}]
Add @var{package}, a package for a screen locker or screen saver whose
command is @var{program}, to the set of setuid programs and add a PAM entry
for it.  For example:

@lisp
(screen-locker-service xlockmore "xlock")

@node Printing Services
@subsection Printing Services

@cindex printer support with CUPS
The @code{(gnu services cups)} module provides a Guix service definition
for the CUPS printing service.  To add printer support to a Guix
system, add a @code{cups-service} to the operating system definition:

@deffn {Scheme Variable} cups-service-type
The service type for the CUPS print server.  Its value should be a valid
CUPS configuration (see below).  To use the default settings, simply
write:
@example
(service cups-service-type)
@end example
@end deffn

The CUPS configuration controls the basic things about your CUPS
installation: what interfaces it listens on, what to do if a print job
fails, how much logging to do, and so on.  To actually add a printer,
you have to visit the @url{http://localhost:631} URL, or use a tool such
as GNOME's printer configuration services.  By default, configuring a
CUPS service will generate a self-signed certificate if needed, for
secure connections to the print server.

Suppose you want to enable the Web interface of CUPS and also add
support for Epson printers @i{via} the @code{escpr} package and for HP
printers @i{via} the @code{hplip-minimal} package.  You can do that directly,
like this (you need to use the @code{(gnu packages cups)} module):

@example
(service cups-service-type
         (cups-configuration
           (web-interface? #t)
           (extensions
             (list cups-filters escpr hplip-minimal))))
@end example

Note: If you wish to use the Qt5 based GUI which comes with the hplip
package then it is suggested that you install the @code{hplip} package,
either in your OS configuration file or as your user.

The available configuration parameters follow.  Each parameter
definition is preceded by its type; for example, @samp{string-list foo}
indicates that the @code{foo} parameter should be specified as a list of
strings.  There is also a way to specify the configuration as a string,
if you have an old @code{cupsd.conf} file that you want to port over
from some other system; see the end for more details.

@c The following documentation was initially generated by
@c (generate-documentation) in (gnu services cups).  Manually maintained
@c documentation is better, so we shouldn't hesitate to edit below as
@c needed.  However if the change you want to make to this documentation
@c can be done in an automated way, it's probably easier to change
@c (generate-documentation) than to make it below and have to deal with
@c the churn as CUPS updates.


Available @code{cups-configuration} fields are:

@deftypevr {@code{cups-configuration} parameter} package cups
The CUPS package.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{cups-configuration} parameter} package-list extensions
Drivers and other extensions to the CUPS package.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{cups-configuration} parameter} files-configuration files-configuration
Configuration of where to write logs, what directories to use for print
spools, and related privileged configuration parameters.

Available @code{files-configuration} fields are:

@deftypevr {@code{files-configuration} parameter} log-location access-log
Defines the access log filename.  Specifying a blank filename disables
access log generation.  The value @code{stderr} causes log entries to be
sent to the standard error file when the scheduler is running in the
foreground, or to the system log daemon when run in the background.  The
value @code{syslog} causes log entries to be sent to the system log
daemon.  The server name may be included in filenames using the string
@code{%s}, as in @code{/var/log/cups/%s-access_log}.

Defaults to @samp{"/var/log/cups/access_log"}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{files-configuration} parameter} file-name cache-dir
Where CUPS should cache data.

Defaults to @samp{"/var/cache/cups"}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{files-configuration} parameter} string config-file-perm
Specifies the permissions for all configuration files that the scheduler
writes.

Note that the permissions for the printers.conf file are currently
masked to only allow access from the scheduler user (typically root).
This is done because printer device URIs sometimes contain sensitive
authentication information that should not be generally known on the
system.  There is no way to disable this security feature.

Defaults to @samp{"0640"}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{files-configuration} parameter} log-location error-log
Defines the error log filename.  Specifying a blank filename disables
access log generation.  The value @code{stderr} causes log entries to be
sent to the standard error file when the scheduler is running in the
foreground, or to the system log daemon when run in the background.  The
value @code{syslog} causes log entries to be sent to the system log
daemon.  The server name may be included in filenames using the string
@code{%s}, as in @code{/var/log/cups/%s-error_log}.

Defaults to @samp{"/var/log/cups/error_log"}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{files-configuration} parameter} string fatal-errors
Specifies which errors are fatal, causing the scheduler to exit.  The
kind strings are:

@table @code
@item none
No errors are fatal.

@item all
All of the errors below are fatal.

@item browse
Browsing initialization errors are fatal, for example failed connections
to the DNS-SD daemon.

@item config
Configuration file syntax errors are fatal.

@item listen
Listen or Port errors are fatal, except for IPv6 failures on the
loopback or @code{any} addresses.

@item log
Log file creation or write errors are fatal.

@item permissions
Bad startup file permissions are fatal, for example shared TLS
certificate and key files with world-read permissions.
@end table

Defaults to @samp{"all -browse"}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{files-configuration} parameter} boolean file-device?
Specifies whether the file pseudo-device can be used for new printer
queues.  The URI @uref{file:///dev/null} is always allowed.

Defaults to @samp{#f}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{files-configuration} parameter} string group
Specifies the group name or ID that will be used when executing external
programs.

Defaults to @samp{"lp"}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{files-configuration} parameter} string log-file-perm
Specifies the permissions for all log files that the scheduler writes.

Defaults to @samp{"0644"}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{files-configuration} parameter} log-location page-log
Defines the page log filename.  Specifying a blank filename disables
access log generation.  The value @code{stderr} causes log entries to be
sent to the standard error file when the scheduler is running in the
foreground, or to the system log daemon when run in the background.  The
value @code{syslog} causes log entries to be sent to the system log
daemon.  The server name may be included in filenames using the string
@code{%s}, as in @code{/var/log/cups/%s-page_log}.

Defaults to @samp{"/var/log/cups/page_log"}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{files-configuration} parameter} string remote-root
Specifies the username that is associated with unauthenticated accesses
by clients claiming to be the root user.  The default is @code{remroot}.

Defaults to @samp{"remroot"}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{files-configuration} parameter} file-name request-root
Specifies the directory that contains print jobs and other HTTP request

limit of 0 disables filter limiting.  An average print to a
non-PostScript printer needs a filter limit of about 200.  A PostScript
printer needs about half that (100).  Setting the limit below these
thresholds will effectively limit the scheduler to printing a single job
at any time.

Defaults to @samp{0}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{cups-configuration} parameter} non-negative-integer filter-nice
Specifies the scheduling priority of filters that are run to print a

Specifies whether to do reverse lookups on connecting clients.  The
@code{double} setting causes @code{cupsd} to verify that the hostname
resolved from the address matches one of the addresses returned for that
hostname.  Double lookups also prevent clients with unregistered
addresses from connecting to your server.  Only set this option to
@code{#t} or @code{double} if absolutely required.

Defaults to @samp{#f}.

@deftypevr {@code{cups-configuration} parameter} non-negative-integer job-kill-delay
Specifies the number of seconds to wait before killing the filters and
backend associated with a canceled or held job.

Defaults to @samp{30}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{cups-configuration} parameter} non-negative-integer job-retry-interval
Specifies the interval between retries of jobs in seconds.  This is
typically used for fax queues but can also be used with normal print
queues whose error policy is @code{retry-job} or

Defaults to @samp{30}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{cups-configuration} parameter} non-negative-integer job-retry-limit
Specifies the number of retries that are done for jobs.  This is
typically used for fax queues but can also be used with normal print
queues whose error policy is @code{retry-job} or
@code{retry-current-job}.

Defaults to @samp{5}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{cups-configuration} parameter} boolean keep-alive?

@deftypevr {@code{cups-configuration} parameter} multiline-string-list listen
Listens on the specified interfaces for connections.  Valid values are
of the form @var{address}:@var{port}, where @var{address} is either an
IPv6 address enclosed in brackets, an IPv4 address, or @code{*} to
indicate all addresses.  Values can also be file names of local UNIX
domain sockets.  The Listen directive is similar to the Port directive
but allows you to restrict access to specific interfaces or networks.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{cups-configuration} parameter} non-negative-integer listen-back-log
Specifies the number of pending connections that will be allowed.  This
normally only affects very busy servers that have reached the MaxClients
limit, but can also be triggered by large numbers of simultaneous
connections.  When the limit is reached, the operating system will
refuse additional connections until the scheduler can accept the pending
ones.

Defaults to @samp{128}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{cups-configuration} parameter} location-access-control-list location-access-controls

Specifies an access list for a job's private values.  @code{@@ACL} maps
to the printer's requesting-user-name-allowed or
requesting-user-name-denied values.  @code{@@OWNER} maps to the job's
owner.  @code{@@SYSTEM} maps to the groups listed for the
@code{system-group} field of the @code{files-config} configuration,
which is reified into the @code{cups-files.conf(5)} file.  Other
possible elements of the access list include specific user names, and
@code{@@@var{group}} to indicate members of a specific group.  The
access list may also be simply @code{all} or @code{default}.

Defaults to @samp{"root@@localhost.localdomain"}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{cups-configuration} parameter} host-name-list-or-* server-alias
The ServerAlias directive is used for HTTP Host header validation when
clients connect to the scheduler from external interfaces.  Using the
special name @code{*} can expose your system to known browser-based DNS
rebinding attacks, even when accessing sites through a firewall.  If the
auto-discovery of alternate names does not work, we recommend listing
each alternate name with a ServerAlias directive instead of using
@code{*}.

Defaults to @samp{*}.

Defaults to @samp{"variable value"}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{cups-configuration} parameter} multiline-string-list ssl-listen

values are of the form @var{address}:@var{port}, where @var{address} is
either an IPv6 address enclosed in brackets, an IPv4 address, or
@code{*} to indicate all addresses.

Defaults to @samp{()}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{cups-configuration} parameter} ssl-options ssl-options
Sets encryption options.  By default, CUPS only supports encryption
using TLS v1.0 or higher using known secure cipher suites.  The
@code{AllowRC4} option enables the 128-bit RC4 cipher suites, which are
required for some older clients that do not implement newer ones.  The
@code{AllowSSL3} option enables SSL v3.0, which is required for some
older clients that do not support TLS v1.0.

Defaults to @samp{()}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{cups-configuration} parameter} boolean strict-conformance?
Specifies whether the scheduler requires clients to strictly adhere to

Specifies whether the web interface is enabled.

Defaults to @samp{#f}.
@end deftypevr

At this point you're probably thinking ``oh dear, Guix manual, I like
you but you can stop already with the configuration options''.  Indeed.
However, one more point: it could be that you have an existing
@code{cupsd.conf} that you want to use.  In that case, you can pass an
@code{opaque-cups-configuration} as the configuration of a
@code{cups-service-type}.

Available @code{opaque-cups-configuration} fields are:

@deftypevr {@code{opaque-cups-configuration} parameter} package cups
The CUPS package.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{opaque-cups-configuration} parameter} string cupsd.conf
The contents of the @code{cupsd.conf}, as a string.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{opaque-cups-configuration} parameter} string cups-files.conf
The contents of the @code{cups-files.conf} file, as a string.
@end deftypevr

For example, if your @code{cupsd.conf} and @code{cups-files.conf} are in
strings of the same name, you could instantiate a CUPS service like
this:

@example
(service cups-service-type
         (opaque-cups-configuration
           (cupsd.conf cupsd.conf)
           (cups-files.conf cups-files.conf)))
@end example


@node Desktop Services
@subsection Desktop Services

The @code{(gnu services desktop)} module provides services that are
usually useful in the context of a ``desktop'' setup---that is, on a
machine running a graphical display server, possibly with graphical user
interfaces, etc.  It also defines services that provide specific desktop
environments like GNOME, Xfce or MATE.

To simplify things, the module defines a variable containing the set of
services that users typically expect on a machine with a graphical
environment and networking:

@defvr {Scheme Variable} %desktop-services
This is a list of services that builds upon @var{%base-services} and
adds or adjusts services for a typical ``desktop'' setup.

In particular, it adds a graphical login manager (@pxref{X Window,
@code{gdm-service-type}}), screen lockers, a network management tool
(@pxref{Networking Services, @code{network-manager-service-type}}), energy and color
management services, the @code{elogind} login and seat manager, the
Polkit privilege service, the GeoClue location service, the
AccountsService daemon that allows authorized users change system
passwords, an NTP client (@pxref{Networking Services}), the Avahi
daemon, and has the name service switch service configured to be able to
use @code{nss-mdns} (@pxref{Name Service Switch, mDNS}).
@end defvr

The @var{%desktop-services} variable can be used as the @code{services}
field of an @code{operating-system} declaration (@pxref{operating-system
Reference, @code{services}}).

Additionally, the @code{gnome-desktop-service-type},
@code{xfce-desktop-service}, @code{mate-desktop-service-type} and
@code{enlightenment-desktop-service-type} procedures can add GNOME, Xfce, MATE
and/or Enlightenment to a system.  To ``add GNOME'' means that system-level
services like the backlight adjustment helpers and the power management
utilities are added to the system, extending @code{polkit} and @code{dbus}
appropriately, allowing GNOME to operate with elevated privileges on a
limited number of special-purpose system interfaces.  Additionally,
adding a service made by @code{gnome-desktop-service-type} adds the GNOME
metapackage to the system profile.  Likewise, adding the Xfce service
not only adds the @code{xfce} metapackage to the system profile, but it
also gives the Thunar file manager the ability to open a ``root-mode''
file management window, if the user authenticates using the
administrator's password via the standard polkit graphical interface.
To ``add MATE'' means that @code{polkit} and @code{dbus} are extended
appropriately, allowing MATE to operate with elevated privileges on a
limited number of special-purpose system interfaces.  Additionally,
adding a service of type @code{mate-desktop-service-type} adds the MATE
metapackage to the system profile.  ``Adding Enlightenment'' means that
@code{dbus} is extended appropriately, and several of Enlightenment's binaries
are set as setuid, allowing Enlightenment's screen locker and other
functionality to work as expetected.

The desktop environments in Guix use the Xorg display server by
default.  If you'd like to use the newer display server protocol
called Wayland, you need to use the @code{sddm-service} instead of
GDM as the graphical login manager.  You should then
select the ``GNOME (Wayland)'' session in SDDM.  Alternatively you can
also try starting GNOME on Wayland manually from a TTY with the
command ``XDG_SESSION_TYPE=wayland exec dbus-run-session
gnome-session``.  Currently only GNOME has support for Wayland.

Because the GNOME, Xfce and MATE desktop services pull in so many packages,
the default @code{%desktop-services} variable doesn't include any of
them by default.  To add GNOME, Xfce or MATE, just @code{cons} them onto
@code{%desktop-services} in the @code{services} field of your
@code{operating-system}:

@example
(use-modules (gnu))
(use-service-modules desktop)
(operating-system
  ...
  ;; cons* adds items to the list given as its last argument.
  (services (cons* (service gnome-desktop-service-type)
                   (service xfce-desktop-service)
                   %desktop-services))
  ...)
@end example

These desktop environments will then be available as options in the
graphical login window.

The actual service definitions included in @code{%desktop-services} and
provided by @code{(gnu services dbus)} and @code{(gnu services desktop)}
are described below.

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} dbus-service [#:dbus @var{dbus}] [#:services '()]
Return a service that runs the ``system bus'', using @var{dbus}, with
support for @var{services}.

@uref{http://dbus.freedesktop.org/, D-Bus} is an inter-process communication
facility.  Its system bus is used to allow system services to communicate
and to be notified of system-wide events.

@var{services} must be a list of packages that provide an
@file{etc/dbus-1/system.d} directory containing additional D-Bus configuration
and policy files.  For example, to allow avahi-daemon to use the system bus,
@var{services} must be equal to @code{(list avahi)}.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} elogind-service [#:config @var{config}]
Return a service that runs the @code{elogind} login and
seat management daemon.  @uref{https://github.com/elogind/elogind,
Elogind} exposes a D-Bus interface that can be used to know which users
are logged in, know what kind of sessions they have open, suspend the
system, inhibit system suspend, reboot the system, and other tasks.

Elogind handles most system-level power events for a computer, for
example suspending the system when a lid is closed, or shutting it down
when the power button is pressed.

The @var{config} keyword argument specifies the configuration for
elogind, and should be the result of an @code{(elogind-configuration

@node Sound Services
@subsection Sound Services

@cindex sound support
@cindex ALSA
@cindex PulseAudio, sound support

The @code{(gnu services sound)} module provides a service to configure the
Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) system, which makes PulseAudio the
preferred ALSA output driver.

@deffn {Scheme Variable} alsa-service-type
This is the type for the @uref{https://alsa-project.org/, Advanced Linux Sound
Architecture} (ALSA) system, which generates the @file{/etc/asound.conf}
configuration file.  The value for this type is a @command{alsa-configuration}
record as in this example:

@example
(service alsa-service-type)
@end example

See below for details about @code{alsa-configuration}.
@end deffn

@deftp {Data Type} alsa-configuration
Data type representing the configuration for @code{alsa-service}.

@table @asis
@item @code{alsa-plugins} (default: @var{alsa-plugins})
@code{alsa-plugins} package to use.

@item @code{pulseaudio?} (default: @var{#t})
Whether ALSA applications should transparently be made to use the
@uref{http://www.pulseaudio.org/, PulseAudio} sound server.

Using PulseAudio allows you to run several sound-producing applications
at the same time and to individual control them @i{via}
@command{pavucontrol}, among other things.

@item @code{extra-options} (default: @var{""})
String to append to the @file{/etc/asound.conf} file.

@end table
@end deftp

Individual users who want to override the system configuration of ALSA can do
it with the @file{~/.asoundrc} file:

@example
# In guix, we have to specify the absolute path for plugins.
pcm_type.jack @{
  lib "/home/alice/.guix-profile/lib/alsa-lib/libasound_module_pcm_jack.so"
@}

# Routing ALSA to jack:
# <http://jackaudio.org/faq/routing_alsa.html>.
pcm.rawjack @{
  type jack
  playback_ports @{
    0 system:playback_1
    1 system:playback_2
  @}

  capture_ports @{
    0 system:capture_1
    1 system:capture_2
  @}
@}

pcm.!default @{

@node Database Services
@subsection Database Services

@cindex database
@cindex SQL
The @code{(gnu services databases)} module provides the following services.

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} postgresql-service [#:postgresql postgresql] @
       [#:config-file] [#:data-directory ``/var/lib/postgresql/data''] @
       [#:port 5432] [#:locale ``en_US.utf8''] [#:extension-packages '()]
Return a service that runs @var{postgresql}, the PostgreSQL database
server.

The PostgreSQL daemon loads its runtime configuration from @var{config-file},
creates a database cluster with @var{locale} as the default
locale, stored in @var{data-directory}.  It then listens on @var{port}.

@cindex postgresql extension-packages
Additional extensions are loaded from packages listed in
@var{extension-packages}.  Extensions are available at runtime.  For instance,
to create a geographic database using the @code{postgis} extension, a user can
configure the postgresql-service as in this example:

@cindex postgis
@example
(use-package-modules databases geo)

(operating-system
  ...
  ;; postgresql is required to run `psql' but postgis is not required for
  ;; proper operation.
  (packages (cons* postgresql %base-packages))
  (services
    (cons*
      (postgresql-service #:extension-packages (list postgis))
      %base-services)))
@end example

Then the extension becomes visible and you can initialise an empty geographic
database in this way:

@example
psql -U postgres
> create database postgistest;
> \connect postgistest;
> create extension postgis;
> create extension postgis_topology;
@end example

There is no need to add this field for contrib extensions such as hstore or
dblink as they are already loadable by postgresql.  This field is only
required to add extensions provided by other packages.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} mysql-service [#:config (mysql-configuration)]

@end table
@end deftp

@node Mail Services
@subsection Mail Services

@cindex mail
@cindex email
The @code{(gnu services mail)} module provides Guix service definitions
for email services: IMAP, POP3, and LMTP servers, as well as mail
transport agents (MTAs).  Lots of acronyms!  These services are detailed
in the subsections below.

@subsubheading Dovecot Service

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} dovecot-service [#:config (dovecot-configuration)]
Return a service that runs the Dovecot IMAP/POP3/LMTP mail server.
@end deffn

By default, Dovecot does not need much configuration; the default
configuration object created by @code{(dovecot-configuration)} will
suffice if your mail is delivered to @code{~/Maildir}.  A self-signed
certificate will be generated for TLS-protected connections, though
Dovecot will also listen on cleartext ports by default.  There are a
number of options, though, which mail administrators might need to change,
and as is the case with other services, Guix allows the system
administrator to specify these parameters via a uniform Scheme interface.

For example, to specify that mail is located at @code{maildir~/.mail},
one would instantiate the Dovecot service like this:

@example
(dovecot-service #:config
                 (dovecot-configuration
                  (mail-location "maildir:~/.mail")))
@end example

The available configuration parameters follow.  Each parameter
definition is preceded by its type; for example, @samp{string-list foo}
indicates that the @code{foo} parameter should be specified as a list of
strings.  There is also a way to specify the configuration as a string,
if you have an old @code{dovecot.conf} file that you want to port over
from some other system; see the end for more details.

@c The following documentation was initially generated by
@c (generate-documentation) in (gnu services mail).  Manually maintained
@c documentation is better, so we shouldn't hesitate to edit below as
@c needed.  However if the change you want to make to this documentation
@c can be done in an automated way, it's probably easier to change
@c (generate-documentation) than to make it below and have to deal with
@c the churn as dovecot updates.

@deftypevr {@code{userdb-configuration} parameter} space-separated-string-list args
Space separated list of arguments to the userdb driver.
Defaults to @samp{""}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{userdb-configuration} parameter} free-form-args override-fields
Override fields from passwd.
Defaults to @samp{()}.
@end deftypevr

@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} plugin-configuration plugin-configuration
Plug-in configuration, created by the @code{plugin-configuration}
constructor.
@end deftypevr

List of namespaces.  Each item in the list is created by the
@code{namespace-configuration} constructor.

Available @code{namespace-configuration} fields are:

@deftypevr {@code{namespace-configuration} parameter} string name
Name for this namespace.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{namespace-configuration} parameter} string type
Namespace type: @samp{private}, @samp{shared} or @samp{public}.
Defaults to @samp{"private"}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{namespace-configuration} parameter} string separator
Hierarchy separator to use. You should use the same separator for
all namespaces or some clients get confused.  @samp{/} is usually a good
one.  The default however depends on the underlying mail storage
format.
Defaults to @samp{""}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{namespace-configuration} parameter} string prefix
Prefix required to access this namespace.  This needs to be
different for all namespaces. For example @samp{Public/}.
Defaults to @samp{""}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{namespace-configuration} parameter} string location
Physical location of the mailbox. This is in the same format as
mail_location, which is also the default for it.
Defaults to @samp{""}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{namespace-configuration} parameter} boolean inbox?
There can be only one INBOX, and this setting defines which
namespace has it.
Defaults to @samp{#f}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{namespace-configuration} parameter} boolean hidden?
If namespace is hidden, it's not advertised to clients via NAMESPACE
extension. You'll most likely also want to set @samp{list? #f}.  This is mostly
useful when converting from another server with different namespaces
which you want to deprecate but still keep working.  For example you can
create hidden namespaces with prefixes @samp{~/mail/}, @samp{~%u/mail/}
and @samp{mail/}.
Defaults to @samp{#f}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{namespace-configuration} parameter} boolean list?
Show the mailboxes under this namespace with the LIST command. This
makes the namespace visible for clients that do not support the NAMESPACE
extension.  The special @code{children} value lists child mailboxes, but
hides the namespace prefix.
Defaults to @samp{#t}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{namespace-configuration} parameter} boolean subscriptions?
Namespace handles its own subscriptions.  If set to @code{#f}, the
parent namespace handles them.  The empty prefix should always have this
as @code{#t}).
Defaults to @samp{#t}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{namespace-configuration} parameter} mailbox-configuration-list mailboxes
List of predefined mailboxes in this namespace.
Defaults to @samp{()}.

Available @code{mailbox-configuration} fields are:

@deftypevr {@code{mailbox-configuration} parameter} string name
Name for this mailbox.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{mailbox-configuration} parameter} string auto
@samp{create} will automatically create this mailbox.
@samp{subscribe} will both create and subscribe to the mailbox.
Defaults to @samp{"no"}.
@end deftypevr

Defaults to @samp{()}.
@end deftypevr

@end deftypevr

@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} file-name base-dir
Base directory where to store runtime data.
Defaults to @samp{"/var/run/dovecot/"}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} string login-greeting
Greeting message for clients.
Defaults to @samp{"Dovecot ready."}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} space-separated-string-list login-trusted-networks
List of trusted network ranges.  Connections from these IPs are
allowed to override their IP addresses and ports (for logging and for
authentication checks).  @samp{disable-plaintext-auth} is also ignored
for these networks.  Typically you would specify your IMAP proxy servers
here.
Defaults to @samp{()}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} space-separated-string-list login-access-sockets
List of login access check sockets (e.g.@: tcpwrap).
Defaults to @samp{()}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} boolean verbose-proctitle?
Show more verbose process titles (in ps).  Currently shows user name
and IP address.  Useful for seeing who is actually using the IMAP
processes (e.g.@: shared mailboxes or if the same uid is used for multiple
accounts).
Defaults to @samp{#f}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} boolean shutdown-clients?
Should all processes be killed when Dovecot master process shuts down.
Setting this to @code{#f} means that Dovecot can be upgraded without
forcing existing client connections to close (although that could also
be a problem if the upgrade is e.g.@: due to a security fix).
Defaults to @samp{#t}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} non-negative-integer doveadm-worker-count
If non-zero, run mail commands via this many connections to doveadm
server, instead of running them directly in the same process.
Defaults to @samp{0}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} string doveadm-socket-path
UNIX socket or host:port used for connecting to doveadm server.
Defaults to @samp{"doveadm-server"}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} space-separated-string-list import-environment
List of environment variables that are preserved on Dovecot startup
and passed down to all of its child processes.  You can also give
key=value pairs to always set specific settings.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} boolean disable-plaintext-auth?
Disable LOGIN command and all other plaintext authentications unless
SSL/TLS is used (LOGINDISABLED capability).  Note that if the remote IP
matches the local IP (i.e.@: you're connecting from the same computer),
the connection is considered secure and plaintext authentication is
allowed.  See also ssl=required setting.
Defaults to @samp{#t}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} non-negative-integer auth-cache-size
Authentication cache size (e.g.@: @samp{#e10e6}).  0 means it's disabled.
Note that bsdauth, PAM and vpopmail require @samp{cache-key} to be set
for caching to be used.
Defaults to @samp{0}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} string auth-cache-ttl
Time to live for cached data.  After TTL expires the cached record
is no longer used, *except* if the main database lookup returns internal
failure.  We also try to handle password changes automatically: If
user's previous authentication was successful, but this one wasn't, the
cache isn't used.  For now this works only with plaintext
authentication.
Defaults to @samp{"1 hour"}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} string auth-cache-negative-ttl
TTL for negative hits (user not found, password mismatch).
0 disables caching them completely.
Defaults to @samp{"1 hour"}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} space-separated-string-list auth-realms
List of realms for SASL authentication mechanisms that need them.
You can leave it empty if you don't want to support multiple realms.
Many clients simply use the first one listed here, so keep the default
realm first.
Defaults to @samp{()}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} string auth-default-realm
Default realm/domain to use if none was specified.  This is used for
both SASL realms and appending @@domain to username in plaintext
logins.
Defaults to @samp{""}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} string auth-username-chars
List of allowed characters in username.  If the user-given username
contains a character not listed in here, the login automatically fails.
This is just an extra check to make sure user can't exploit any
potential quote escaping vulnerabilities with SQL/LDAP databases.  If
you want to allow all characters, set this value to empty.
Defaults to @samp{"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ01234567890.-_@@"}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} string auth-username-translation
Username character translations before it's looked up from
databases.  The value contains series of from -> to characters.  For
example @samp{#@@/@@} means that @samp{#} and @samp{/} characters are
translated to @samp{@@}.
Defaults to @samp{""}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} string auth-username-format
Username formatting before it's looked up from databases.  You can
use the standard variables here, e.g.@: %Lu would lowercase the username,
%n would drop away the domain if it was given, or @samp{%n-AT-%d} would
change the @samp{@@} into @samp{-AT-}.  This translation is done after
@samp{auth-username-translation} changes.
Defaults to @samp{"%Lu"}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} string auth-master-user-separator
If you want to allow master users to log in by specifying the master
username within the normal username string (i.e.@: not using SASL
mechanism's support for it), you can specify the separator character
here.  The format is then <username><separator><master username>.
UW-IMAP uses @samp{*} as the separator, so that could be a good
choice.
Defaults to @samp{""}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} string auth-anonymous-username
Username to use for users logging in with ANONYMOUS SASL
mechanism.
Defaults to @samp{"anonymous"}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} non-negative-integer auth-worker-max-count
Maximum number of dovecot-auth worker processes.  They're used to
execute blocking passdb and userdb queries (e.g.@: MySQL and PAM).
They're automatically created and destroyed as needed.
Defaults to @samp{30}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} string auth-gssapi-hostname
Host name to use in GSSAPI principal names.  The default is to use
the name returned by gethostname().  Use @samp{$ALL} (with quotes) to
allow all keytab entries.
Defaults to @samp{""}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} string auth-krb5-keytab
Kerberos keytab to use for the GSSAPI mechanism.  Will use the
system default (usually @file{/etc/krb5.keytab}) if not specified.  You may
need to change the auth service to run as root to be able to read this
file.
Defaults to @samp{""}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} boolean auth-use-winbind?
Do NTLM and GSS-SPNEGO authentication using Samba's winbind daemon
and @samp{ntlm-auth} helper.

Defaults to @samp{#f}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} file-name auth-winbind-helper-path
Path for Samba's @samp{ntlm-auth} helper binary.
Defaults to @samp{"/usr/bin/ntlm_auth"}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} string auth-failure-delay
Time to delay before replying to failed authentications.
Defaults to @samp{"2 secs"}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} boolean auth-ssl-require-client-cert?
Require a valid SSL client certificate or the authentication
fails.
Defaults to @samp{#f}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} boolean auth-ssl-username-from-cert?
Take the username from client's SSL certificate, using
@code{X509_NAME_get_text_by_NID()} which returns the subject's DN's
CommonName.
Defaults to @samp{#f}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} space-separated-string-list auth-mechanisms
List of wanted authentication mechanisms.  Supported mechanisms are:
@samp{plain}, @samp{login}, @samp{digest-md5}, @samp{cram-md5},

@samp{otp}, @samp{skey}, and @samp{gss-spnego}.  NOTE: See also
@samp{disable-plaintext-auth} setting.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} space-separated-string-list director-servers
List of IPs or hostnames to all director servers, including ourself.
Ports can be specified as ip:port.  The default port is the same as what
director service's @samp{inet-listener} is using.
Defaults to @samp{()}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} space-separated-string-list director-mail-servers
List of IPs or hostnames to all backend mail servers.  Ranges are

How long to redirect users to a specific server after it no longer
has any connections.
Defaults to @samp{"15 min"}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} string director-username-hash
How the username is translated before being hashed.  Useful values
include %Ln if user can log in with or without @@domain, %Ld if mailboxes
are shared within domain.
Defaults to @samp{"%Lu"}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} string log-path
Log file to use for error messages.  @samp{syslog} logs to syslog,
@samp{/dev/stderr} logs to stderr.
Defaults to @samp{"syslog"}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} string info-log-path

@samp{log-path}.
Defaults to @samp{""}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} string debug-log-path
Log file to use for debug messages.  Defaults to
@samp{info-log-path}.
Defaults to @samp{""}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} string syslog-facility
Syslog facility to use if you're logging to syslog.  Usually if you
don't want to use @samp{mail}, you'll use local0..local7.  Also other
standard facilities are supported.
Defaults to @samp{"mail"}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} boolean auth-verbose?
Log unsuccessful authentication attempts and the reasons why they
failed.
Defaults to @samp{#f}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} boolean auth-verbose-passwords?
In case of password mismatches, log the attempted password.  Valid
values are no, plain and sha1.  sha1 can be useful for detecting brute
force password attempts vs.  user simply trying the same password over
and over again.  You can also truncate the value to n chars by appending
":n" (e.g.@: sha1:6).
Defaults to @samp{#f}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} boolean auth-debug?
Even more verbose logging for debugging purposes.  Shows for example
SQL queries.
Defaults to @samp{#f}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} boolean auth-debug-passwords?
In case of password mismatches, log the passwords and used scheme so
the problem can be debugged.  Enabling this also enables
@samp{auth-debug}.
Defaults to @samp{#f}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} boolean mail-debug?
Enable mail process debugging.  This can help you figure out why
Dovecot isn't finding your mails.
Defaults to @samp{#f}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} boolean verbose-ssl?
Show protocol level SSL errors.
Defaults to @samp{#f}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} string log-timestamp
Prefix for each line written to log file.  % codes are in
strftime(3) format.
Defaults to @samp{"\"%b %d %H:%M:%S \""}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} space-separated-string-list login-log-format-elements
List of elements we want to log.  The elements which have a
non-empty variable value are joined together to form a comma-separated
string.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} string login-log-format
Login log format.  %s contains @samp{login-log-format-elements}
string, %$ contains the data we want to log.
Defaults to @samp{"%$: %s"}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} string mail-log-prefix
Log prefix for mail processes.  See doc/wiki/Variables.txt for list
of possible variables you can use.
Defaults to @samp{"\"%s(%u)<%@{pid@}><%@{session@}>: \""}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} string deliver-log-format
Format to use for logging mail deliveries.  You can use variables:
@table @code
@item %$
Delivery status message (e.g.@: @samp{saved to INBOX})
@item %m
Message-ID
@item %s
Subject
@item %f
From address
@item %p
Physical size
@item %w
Virtual size.
@end table
Defaults to @samp{"msgid=%m: %$"}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} string mail-location
Location for users' mailboxes.  The default is empty, which means
that Dovecot tries to find the mailboxes automatically.  This won't work
if the user doesn't yet have any mail, so you should explicitly tell
Dovecot the full location.

If you're using mbox, giving a path to the INBOX
file (e.g.@: /var/mail/%u) isn't enough.  You'll also need to tell Dovecot
where the other mailboxes are kept.  This is called the "root mail
directory", and it must be the first path given in the
@samp{mail-location} setting.

There are a few special variables you can use, eg.:

@table @samp
@item %u
username
@item %n
user part in user@@domain, same as %u if there's no domain
@item %d
domain part in user@@domain, empty if there's no domain
@item %h
home director
@end table

See doc/wiki/Variables.txt for full list.  Some examples:
@table @samp
@item maildir:~/Maildir
@item mbox:~/mail:INBOX=/var/mail/%u
@item mbox:/var/mail/%d/%1n/%n:INDEX=/var/indexes/%d/%1n/%
@end table
Defaults to @samp{""}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} string mail-uid
System user and group used to access mails.  If you use multiple,
userdb can override these by returning uid or gid fields.  You can use
either numbers or names.  <doc/wiki/UserIds.txt>.
Defaults to @samp{""}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} string mail-gid

Defaults to @samp{""}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} string mail-privileged-group
Group to enable temporarily for privileged operations.  Currently
this is used only with INBOX when either its initial creation or
dotlocking fails.  Typically this is set to "mail" to give access to
/var/mail.
Defaults to @samp{""}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} string mail-access-groups
Grant access to these supplementary groups for mail processes.
Typically these are used to set up access to shared mailboxes.  Note
that it may be dangerous to set these if users can create
symlinks (e.g.@: if "mail" group is set here, ln -s /var/mail ~/mail/var
could allow a user to delete others' mailboxes, or ln -s
/secret/shared/box ~/mail/mybox would allow reading it).
Defaults to @samp{""}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} boolean mail-full-filesystem-access?
Allow full file system access to clients.  There's no access checks
other than what the operating system does for the active UID/GID.  It
works with both maildir and mboxes, allowing you to prefix mailboxes
names with e.g.@: /path/ or ~user/.
Defaults to @samp{#f}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} boolean mmap-disable?
Don't use mmap() at all.  This is required if you store indexes to
shared file systems (NFS or clustered file system).
Defaults to @samp{#f}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} boolean dotlock-use-excl?
Rely on @samp{O_EXCL} to work when creating dotlock files.  NFS
supports @samp{O_EXCL} since version 3, so this should be safe to use
nowadays by default.
Defaults to @samp{#t}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} string mail-fsync
When to use fsync() or fdatasync() calls:
@table @code
@item optimized
Whenever necessary to avoid losing important data
@item always
Useful with e.g.@: NFS when write()s are delayed
@item never
Never use it (best performance, but crashes can lose data).
@end table
Defaults to @samp{"optimized"}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} boolean mail-nfs-storage?
Mail storage exists in NFS.  Set this to yes to make Dovecot flush
NFS caches whenever needed.  If you're using only a single mail server
this isn't needed.
Defaults to @samp{#f}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} boolean mail-nfs-index?
Mail index files also exist in NFS.  Setting this to yes requires
@samp{mmap-disable? #t} and @samp{fsync-disable? #f}.
Defaults to @samp{#f}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} string lock-method
Locking method for index files.  Alternatives are fcntl, flock and
dotlock.  Dotlocking uses some tricks which may create more disk I/O
than other locking methods.  NFS users: flock doesn't work, remember to
change @samp{mmap-disable}.
Defaults to @samp{"fcntl"}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} file-name mail-temp-dir
Directory in which LDA/LMTP temporarily stores incoming mails >128
kB.
Defaults to @samp{"/tmp"}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} non-negative-integer first-valid-uid
Valid UID range for users.  This is mostly to make sure that users can't
log in as daemons or other system users.  Note that denying root logins is
hardcoded to dovecot binary and can't be done even if @samp{first-valid-uid}
is set to 0.
Defaults to @samp{500}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} non-negative-integer last-valid-uid

Defaults to @samp{0}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} non-negative-integer first-valid-gid
Valid GID range for users.  Users having non-valid GID as primary group ID
aren't allowed to log in.  If user belongs to supplementary groups with
non-valid GIDs, those groups are not set.
Defaults to @samp{1}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} non-negative-integer last-valid-gid

Defaults to @samp{0}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} non-negative-integer mail-max-keyword-length
Maximum allowed length for mail keyword name.  It's only forced when
trying to create new keywords.
Defaults to @samp{50}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} colon-separated-file-name-list valid-chroot-dirs
List of directories under which chrooting is allowed for mail
processes (i.e.@: /var/mail will allow chrooting to /var/mail/foo/bar
too).  This setting doesn't affect @samp{login-chroot}
@samp{mail-chroot} or auth chroot settings.  If this setting is empty,
"/./" in home dirs are ignored.  WARNING: Never add directories here
which local users can modify, that may lead to root exploit.  Usually
this should be done only if you don't allow shell access for users.
<doc/wiki/Chrooting.txt>.
Defaults to @samp{()}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} string mail-chroot
Default chroot directory for mail processes.  This can be overridden
for specific users in user database by giving /./ in user's home
directory (e.g.@: /home/./user chroots into /home).  Note that usually
there is no real need to do chrooting, Dovecot doesn't allow users to
access files outside their mail directory anyway.  If your home
directories are prefixed with the chroot directory, append "/."@: to
@samp{mail-chroot}.  <doc/wiki/Chrooting.txt>.
Defaults to @samp{""}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} file-name auth-socket-path
UNIX socket path to master authentication server to find users.
This is used by imap (for shared users) and lda.
Defaults to @samp{"/var/run/dovecot/auth-userdb"}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} file-name mail-plugin-dir
Directory where to look up mail plugins.
Defaults to @samp{"/usr/lib/dovecot"}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} space-separated-string-list mail-plugins
List of plugins to load for all services.  Plugins specific to IMAP,
LDA, etc.@: are added to this list in their own .conf files.
Defaults to @samp{()}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} non-negative-integer mail-cache-min-mail-count
The minimum number of mails in a mailbox before updates are done to
cache file.  This allows optimizing Dovecot's behavior to do less disk
writes at the cost of more disk reads.
Defaults to @samp{0}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} string mailbox-idle-check-interval
When IDLE command is running, mailbox is checked once in a while to
see if there are any new mails or other changes.  This setting defines
the minimum time to wait between those checks.  Dovecot can also use
dnotify, inotify and kqueue to find out immediately when changes
occur.
Defaults to @samp{"30 secs"}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} boolean mail-save-crlf?
Save mails with CR+LF instead of plain LF.  This makes sending those
mails take less CPU, especially with sendfile() syscall with Linux and
FreeBSD.  But it also creates a bit more disk I/O which may just make it
slower.  Also note that if other software reads the mboxes/maildirs,
they may handle the extra CRs wrong and cause problems.
Defaults to @samp{#f}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} boolean maildir-stat-dirs?
By default LIST command returns all entries in maildir beginning
with a dot.  Enabling this option makes Dovecot return only entries
which are directories.  This is done by stat()ing each entry, so it
causes more disk I/O.
 (For systems setting struct @samp{dirent->d_type} this check is free
and it's done always regardless of this setting).
Defaults to @samp{#f}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} boolean maildir-copy-with-hardlinks?
When copying a message, do it with hard links whenever possible.
This makes the performance much better, and it's unlikely to have any
side effects.
Defaults to @samp{#t}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} boolean maildir-very-dirty-syncs?
Assume Dovecot is the only MUA accessing Maildir: Scan cur/
directory only when its mtime changes unexpectedly or when we can't find
the mail otherwise.
Defaults to @samp{#f}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} space-separated-string-list mbox-read-locks
Which locking methods to use for locking mbox.  There are four
available:

@table @code
@item dotlock
Create <mailbox>.lock file.  This is the oldest and most NFS-safe
solution.  If you want to use /var/mail/ like directory, the users will
need write access to that directory.
@item dotlock-try
Same as dotlock, but if it fails because of permissions or because there
isn't enough disk space, just skip it.
@item fcntl
Use this if possible.  Works with NFS too if lockd is used.
@item flock
May not exist in all systems.  Doesn't work with NFS.
@item lockf
May not exist in all systems.  Doesn't work with NFS.
@end table

You can use multiple locking methods; if you do the order they're declared
in is important to avoid deadlocks if other MTAs/MUAs are using multiple
locking methods as well.  Some operating systems don't allow using some of
them simultaneously.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} space-separated-string-list mbox-write-locks

@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} string mbox-lock-timeout
Maximum time to wait for lock (all of them) before aborting.
Defaults to @samp{"5 mins"}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} string mbox-dotlock-change-timeout
If dotlock exists but the mailbox isn't modified in any way,
override the lock file after this much time.
Defaults to @samp{"2 mins"}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} boolean mbox-dirty-syncs?
When mbox changes unexpectedly we have to fully read it to find out
what changed.  If the mbox is large this can take a long time.  Since
the change is usually just a newly appended mail, it'd be faster to
simply read the new mails.  If this setting is enabled, Dovecot does
this but still safely fallbacks to re-reading the whole mbox file
whenever something in mbox isn't how it's expected to be.  The only real
downside to this setting is that if some other MUA changes message
flags, Dovecot doesn't notice it immediately.  Note that a full sync is
done with SELECT, EXAMINE, EXPUNGE and CHECK commands.
Defaults to @samp{#t}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} boolean mbox-very-dirty-syncs?
Like @samp{mbox-dirty-syncs}, but don't do full syncs even with SELECT,
EXAMINE, EXPUNGE or CHECK commands.  If this is set,
@samp{mbox-dirty-syncs} is ignored.
Defaults to @samp{#f}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} boolean mbox-lazy-writes?
Delay writing mbox headers until doing a full write sync (EXPUNGE
and CHECK commands and when closing the mailbox).  This is especially
useful for POP3 where clients often delete all mails.  The downside is
that our changes aren't immediately visible to other MUAs.
Defaults to @samp{#t}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} non-negative-integer mbox-min-index-size
If mbox size is smaller than this (e.g.@: 100k), don't write index
files.  If an index file already exists it's still read, just not
updated.
Defaults to @samp{0}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} non-negative-integer mdbox-rotate-size
Maximum dbox file size until it's rotated.
Defaults to @samp{10000000}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} string mdbox-rotate-interval
Maximum dbox file age until it's rotated.  Typically in days.  Day
begins from midnight, so 1d = today, 2d = yesterday, etc.  0 = check
disabled.
Defaults to @samp{"1d"}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} boolean mdbox-preallocate-space?
When creating new mdbox files, immediately preallocate their size to
@samp{mdbox-rotate-size}.  This setting currently works only in Linux
with some file systems (ext4, xfs).
Defaults to @samp{#f}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} string mail-attachment-dir
sdbox and mdbox support saving mail attachments to external files,
which also allows single instance storage for them.  Other backends
don't support this for now.

WARNING: This feature hasn't been tested much yet.  Use at your own risk.

Directory root where to store mail attachments.  Disabled, if empty.
Defaults to @samp{""}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} non-negative-integer mail-attachment-min-size
Attachments smaller than this aren't saved externally.  It's also
possible to write a plugin to disable saving specific attachments
externally.
Defaults to @samp{128000}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} string mail-attachment-fs
File system backend to use for saving attachments:
@table @code
@item posix
No SiS done by Dovecot (but this might help FS's own deduplication)
@item sis posix
SiS with immediate byte-by-byte comparison during saving
@item sis-queue posix
SiS with delayed comparison and deduplication.
@end table
Defaults to @samp{"sis posix"}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} string mail-attachment-hash
Hash format to use in attachment filenames.  You can add any text and
variables: @code{%@{md4@}}, @code{%@{md5@}}, @code{%@{sha1@}},
@code{%@{sha256@}}, @code{%@{sha512@}}, @code{%@{size@}}.  Variables can be
truncated, e.g.@: @code{%@{sha256:80@}} returns only first 80 bits.
Defaults to @samp{"%@{sha1@}"}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} non-negative-integer default-process-limit

Defaults to @samp{100}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} non-negative-integer default-client-limit

Defaults to @samp{1000}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} non-negative-integer default-vsz-limit
Default VSZ (virtual memory size) limit for service processes.
This is mainly intended to catch and kill processes that leak memory
before they eat up everything.
Defaults to @samp{256000000}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} string default-login-user
Login user is internally used by login processes.  This is the most
untrusted user in Dovecot system.  It shouldn't have access to anything
at all.
Defaults to @samp{"dovenull"}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} string default-internal-user
Internal user is used by unprivileged processes.  It should be
separate from login user, so that login processes can't disturb other

Defaults to @samp{"</etc/dovecot/default.pem"}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} string ssl-key
PEM encoded SSL/TLS private key.  The key is opened before

root.
Defaults to @samp{"</etc/dovecot/private/default.pem"}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} string ssl-key-password
If key file is password protected, give the password here.
Alternatively give it when starting dovecot with -p parameter.  Since
this file is often world-readable, you may want to place this setting
instead to a different.
Defaults to @samp{""}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} string ssl-ca
PEM encoded trusted certificate authority.  Set this only if you
intend to use @samp{ssl-verify-client-cert? #t}.  The file should
contain the CA certificate(s) followed by the matching
CRL(s).  (e.g.@: @samp{ssl-ca </etc/ssl/certs/ca.pem}).
Defaults to @samp{""}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} boolean ssl-require-crl?
Require that CRL check succeeds for client certificates.
Defaults to @samp{#t}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} boolean ssl-verify-client-cert?
Request client to send a certificate.  If you also want to require
it, set @samp{auth-ssl-require-client-cert? #t} in auth section.
Defaults to @samp{#f}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} string ssl-cert-username-field
Which field from certificate to use for username.  commonName and
x500UniqueIdentifier are the usual choices.  You'll also need to set

Minimum SSL protocol version to accept.
Defaults to @samp{"TLSv1"}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} string ssl-cipher-list

sendmail.
Defaults to @samp{""}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} string rejection-subject
Subject: header to use for rejection mails.  You can use the same
variables as for @samp{rejection-reason} below.
Defaults to @samp{"Rejected: %s"}.

Human readable error message for rejection mails.  You can use
variables:

@table @code
@item %n
CRLF

@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} boolean lda-mailbox-autocreate?
Should saving a mail to a nonexistent mailbox automatically create
it?.
Defaults to @samp{#f}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} boolean lda-mailbox-autosubscribe?
Should automatically created mailboxes be also automatically
subscribed?.
Defaults to @samp{#f}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} non-negative-integer imap-max-line-length
Maximum IMAP command line length.  Some clients generate very long
command lines with huge mailboxes, so you may need to raise this if you
get "Too long argument" or "IMAP command line too large" errors
often.
Defaults to @samp{64000}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} string imap-logout-format
IMAP logout format string:
@table @code
@item %i
total number of bytes read from client
@item %o
total number of bytes sent to client.
@end table
See @file{doc/wiki/Variables.txt} for a list of all the variables you can use.
Defaults to @samp{"in=%i out=%o deleted=%@{deleted@} expunged=%@{expunged@} trashed=%@{trashed@} hdr_count=%@{fetch_hdr_count@} hdr_bytes=%@{fetch_hdr_bytes@} body_count=%@{fetch_body_count@} body_bytes=%@{fetch_body_bytes@}"}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} string imap-capability
Override the IMAP CAPABILITY response.  If the value begins with '+',
add the given capabilities on top of the defaults (e.g.@: +XFOO XBAR).
Defaults to @samp{""}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} string imap-idle-notify-interval
How long to wait between "OK Still here" notifications when client
is IDLEing.
Defaults to @samp{"2 mins"}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} string imap-id-send
ID field names and values to send to clients.  Using * as the value
makes Dovecot use the default value.  The following fields have default
values currently: name, version, os, os-version, support-url,
support-email.
Defaults to @samp{""}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} string imap-id-log
ID fields sent by client to log.  * means everything.
Defaults to @samp{""}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} space-separated-string-list imap-client-workarounds
Workarounds for various client bugs:

@table @code
@item delay-newmail
Send EXISTS/RECENT new mail notifications only when replying to NOOP and
CHECK commands.  Some clients ignore them otherwise, for example OSX
Mail (<v2.1).  Outlook Express breaks more badly though, without this it
may show user "Message no longer in server" errors.  Note that OE6
still breaks even with this workaround if synchronization is set to
"Headers Only".

@item tb-extra-mailbox-sep
Thunderbird gets somehow confused with LAYOUT=fs (mbox and dbox) and
adds extra @samp{/} suffixes to mailbox names.  This option causes Dovecot to
ignore the extra @samp{/} instead of treating it as invalid mailbox name.

@item tb-lsub-flags
Show \Noselect flags for LSUB replies with LAYOUT=fs (e.g.@: mbox).
This makes Thunderbird realize they aren't selectable and show them
greyed out, instead of only later giving "not selectable" popup error.
@end table
Defaults to @samp{()}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{dovecot-configuration} parameter} string imap-urlauth-host
Host allowed in URLAUTH URLs sent by client.  "*" allows all.
Defaults to @samp{""}.
@end deftypevr


Whew!  Lots of configuration options.  The nice thing about it though is
that Guix has a complete interface to Dovecot's configuration
language.  This allows not only a nice way to declare configurations,
but also offers reflective capabilities as well: users can write code to
inspect and transform configurations from within Scheme.

However, it could be that you just want to get a @code{dovecot.conf} up
and running.  In that case, you can pass an
@code{opaque-dovecot-configuration} as the @code{#:config} parameter to
@code{dovecot-service}.  As its name indicates, an opaque configuration
does not have easy reflective capabilities.

Available @code{opaque-dovecot-configuration} fields are:

@deftypevr {@code{opaque-dovecot-configuration} parameter} package dovecot
The dovecot package.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{opaque-dovecot-configuration} parameter} string string
The contents of the @code{dovecot.conf}, as a string.
@end deftypevr

For example, if your @code{dovecot.conf} is just the empty string, you
could instantiate a dovecot service like this:

@example
(dovecot-service #:config
                 (opaque-dovecot-configuration
                  (string "")))
@end example

@subsubheading OpenSMTPD Service

@deffn {Scheme Variable} opensmtpd-service-type
This is the type of the @uref{https://www.opensmtpd.org, OpenSMTPD}
service, whose value should be an @code{opensmtpd-configuration} object
as in this example:

@example
(service opensmtpd-service-type
         (opensmtpd-configuration
           (config-file (local-file "./my-smtpd.conf"))))
@end example
@end deffn

@deftp {Data Type} opensmtpd-configuration
Data type representing the configuration of opensmtpd.

@table @asis
@item @code{package} (default: @var{opensmtpd})
Package object of the OpenSMTPD SMTP server.

@item @code{config-file} (default: @var{%default-opensmtpd-file})
File-like object of the OpenSMTPD configuration file to use.  By default
it listens on the loopback network interface, and allows for mail from
users and daemons on the local machine, as well as permitting email to
remote servers.  Run @command{man smtpd.conf} for more information.

@end table
@end deftp

@subsubheading Exim Service

@cindex mail transfer agent (MTA)
@cindex MTA (mail transfer agent)
@cindex SMTP

@deffn {Scheme Variable} exim-service-type
This is the type of the @uref{https://exim.org, Exim} mail transfer
agent (MTA), whose value should be an @code{exim-configuration} object
as in this example:

@example
(service exim-service-type
         (exim-configuration
           (config-file (local-file "./my-exim.conf"))))
@end example
@end deffn

In order to use an @code{exim-service-type} service you must also have a
@code{mail-aliases-service-type} service present in your
@code{operating-system} (even if it has no aliases).

@deftp {Data Type} exim-configuration
Data type representing the configuration of exim.

@table @asis
@item @code{package} (default: @var{exim})
Package object of the Exim server.

@item @code{config-file} (default: @code{#f})
File-like object of the Exim configuration file to use. If its value is
@code{#f} then use the default configuration file from the package
provided in @code{package}. The resulting configuration file is loaded
after setting the @code{exim_user} and @code{exim_group} configuration
variables.

@end table
@end deftp

@subsubheading Mail Aliases Service

@cindex email aliases
@cindex aliases, for email addresses

@deffn {Scheme Variable} mail-aliases-service-type
This is the type of the service which provides @code{/etc/aliases},
specifying how to deliver mail to users on this system.

@example
(service mail-aliases-service-type
         '(("postmaster" "bob")
           ("bob" "bob@@example.com" "bob@@example2.com")))
@end example
@end deffn

The configuration for a @code{mail-aliases-service-type} service is an
association list denoting how to deliver mail that comes to this
system. Each entry is of the form @code{(alias addresses ...)}, with
@code{alias} specifying the local alias and @code{addresses} specifying
where to deliver this user's mail.

The aliases aren't required to exist as users on the local system. In
the above example, there doesn't need to be a @code{postmaster} entry in
the @code{operating-system}'s @code{user-accounts} in order to deliver
the @code{postmaster} mail to @code{bob} (which subsequently would
deliver mail to @code{bob@@example.com} and @code{bob@@example2.com}).

@subsubheading GNU Mailutils IMAP4 Daemon
@cindex GNU Mailutils IMAP4 Daemon

@deffn {Scheme Variable} imap4d-service-type
This is the type of the GNU Mailutils IMAP4 Daemon (@pxref{imap4d,,,
mailutils, GNU Mailutils Manual}), whose value should be an
@code{imap4d-configuration} object as in this example:

@example
(service imap4d-service-type
         (imap4d-configuration
           (config-file (local-file "imap4d.conf"))))
@end example
@end deffn

@deftp {Data Type} imap4d-configuration
Data type representing the configuration of @command{imap4d}.

@table @asis
@item @code{package} (default: @code{mailutils})
The package that provides @command{imap4d}.

@item @code{config-file} (default: @code{%default-imap4d-config-file})
File-like object of the configuration file to use, by default it will listen
on TCP port 143 of @code{localhost}.  @xref{Conf-imap4d,,, mailutils, GNU
Mailutils Manual}, for details.

@end table
@end deftp

@node Messaging Services
@subsection Messaging Services

@cindex messaging
@cindex jabber
@cindex XMPP
The @code{(gnu services messaging)} module provides Guix service
definitions for messaging services: currently only Prosody is supported.

@subsubheading Prosody Service

@deffn {Scheme Variable} prosody-service-type
This is the type for the @uref{https://prosody.im, Prosody XMPP
communication server}.  Its value must be a @code{prosody-configuration}
record as in this example:

@example
(service prosody-service-type
         (prosody-configuration
          (modules-enabled (cons "groups" "mam" %default-modules-enabled))
          (int-components
           (list
            (int-component-configuration
             (hostname "conference.example.net")
             (plugin "muc")
             (mod-muc (mod-muc-configuration)))))
          (virtualhosts
           (list
            (virtualhost-configuration
             (domain "example.net"))))))
@end example

See below for details about @code{prosody-configuration}.

@end deffn

By default, Prosody does not need much configuration.  Only one
@code{virtualhosts} field is needed: it specifies the domain you wish
Prosody to serve.

You can perform various sanity checks on the generated configuration
with the @code{prosodyctl check} command.

Prosodyctl will also help you to import certificates from the
@code{letsencrypt} directory so that the @code{prosody} user can access
them.  See @url{https://prosody.im/doc/letsencrypt}.

@example
prosodyctl --root cert import /etc/letsencrypt/live
@end example

The available configuration parameters follow.  Each parameter
definition is preceded by its type; for example, @samp{string-list foo}
indicates that the @code{foo} parameter should be specified as a list of
strings.  Types starting with @code{maybe-} denote parameters that won't
show up in @code{prosody.cfg.lua} when their value is @code{'disabled}.

There is also a way to specify the configuration as a string, if you
have an old @code{prosody.cfg.lua} file that you want to port over from
some other system; see the end for more details.

The @code{file-object} type designates either a file-like object
(@pxref{G-Expressions, file-like objects}) or a file name.

@c The following documentation was initially generated by
@c (generate-documentation) in (gnu services messaging).  Manually maintained
@c documentation is better, so we shouldn't hesitate to edit below as
@c needed.  However if the change you want to make to this documentation
@c can be done in an automated way, it's probably easier to change
@c (generate-documentation) than to make it below and have to deal with
@c the churn as Prosody updates.

Available @code{prosody-configuration} fields are:

@deftypevr {@code{prosody-configuration} parameter} package prosody
The Prosody package.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{prosody-configuration} parameter} file-name data-path

Defaults to @samp{()}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{prosody-configuration} parameter} file-name certificates
Every virtual host and component needs a certificate so that clients and
servers can securely verify its identity.  Prosody will automatically load
certificates/keys from the directory specified here.
Defaults to @samp{"/etc/prosody/certs"}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{prosody-configuration} parameter} string-list admins
This is a list of accounts that are admins for the server.  Note that you
must create the accounts separately.  See @url{https://prosody.im/doc/admins} and
@url{https://prosody.im/doc/creating_accounts}.
Example: @code{(admins '("user1@@example.com" "user2@@example.net"))}
Defaults to @samp{()}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{prosody-configuration} parameter} boolean use-libevent?
Enable use of libevent for better performance under high load.  See
@url{https://prosody.im/doc/libevent}.
Defaults to @samp{#f}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{prosody-configuration} parameter} module-list modules-enabled
This is the list of modules Prosody will load on startup.  It looks for
@code{mod_modulename.lua} in the plugins folder, so make sure that exists too.

@url{https://prosody.im/doc/http#external_url}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{prosody-configuration} parameter} virtualhost-configuration-list virtualhosts
A host in Prosody is a domain on which user accounts can be created.  For
example if you want your users to have addresses like
@samp{"john.smith@@example.com"} then you need to add a host
@samp{"example.com"}.  All options in this list will apply only to this host.

Note: the name "virtual" host is used in configuration to avoid confusion with
the actual physical host that Prosody is installed on.  A single Prosody
instance can serve many domains, each one defined as a VirtualHost entry in
Prosody's configuration.  Conversely a server that hosts a single domain would
have just one VirtualHost entry.

See @url{https://prosody.im/doc/configure#virtual_host_settings}.

Available @code{virtualhost-configuration} fields are:

all these @code{prosody-configuration} fields: @code{admins}, @code{use-libevent?}, @code{modules-enabled}, @code{modules-disabled}, @code{groups-file}, @code{allow-registration?}, @code{ssl}, @code{c2s-require-encryption?}, @code{disable-sasl-mechanisms}, @code{s2s-require-encryption?}, @code{s2s-secure-auth?}, @code{s2s-insecure-domains}, @code{s2s-secure-domains}, @code{authentication}, @code{log}, @code{http-max-content-size}, @code{http-external-url}, @code{raw-content}, plus:

Otherwise anyone can create a room.  The value @samp{"local"} restricts room
creation to users on the service's parent domain.  E.g.@: @samp{user@@example.com}
can create rooms on @samp{rooms.example.com}.  The value @samp{"admin"}
restricts to service administrators only.
Defaults to @samp{#f}.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{mod-muc-configuration} parameter} non-negative-integer max-history-messages

@end deftypevr

It could be that you just want to get a @code{prosody.cfg.lua}
up and running.  In that case, you can pass an
@code{opaque-prosody-configuration} record as the value of
@code{prosody-service-type}.  As its name indicates, an opaque configuration
does not have easy reflective capabilities.
Available @code{opaque-prosody-configuration} fields are:

@deftypevr {@code{opaque-prosody-configuration} parameter} package prosody
The prosody package.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{opaque-prosody-configuration} parameter} string prosody.cfg.lua
The contents of the @code{prosody.cfg.lua} to use.
@end deftypevr

For example, if your @code{prosody.cfg.lua} is just the empty
string, you could instantiate a prosody service like this:

@example
(service prosody-service-type
         (opaque-prosody-configuration
          (prosody.cfg.lua "")))

@node Kerberos Services
@subsection Kerberos Services
@cindex Kerberos

The @code{(gnu services kerberos)} module provides services relating to
the authentication protocol @dfn{Kerberos}.

@subsubheading Krb5 Service

Programs using a Kerberos client library normally
expect a configuration file in @file{/etc/krb5.conf}.
This service generates such a file from a definition provided in the
operating system declaration.
It does not cause any daemon to be started.

No ``keytab'' files are provided by this service---you must explicitly create them.
This service is known to work with the MIT client library, @code{mit-krb5}.
Other implementations have not been tested.

@defvr {Scheme Variable} krb5-service-type
A service type for Kerberos 5 clients.
@end defvr

@noindent
Here is an example of its use:
@lisp
(service krb5-service-type
         (krb5-configuration
          (default-realm "EXAMPLE.COM")
          (allow-weak-crypto? #t)
          (realms (list
                   (krb5-realm
                    (name "EXAMPLE.COM")
                    (admin-server "groucho.example.com")
                    (kdc "karl.example.com"))
                   (krb5-realm
                    (name "ARGRX.EDU")
                    (admin-server "kerb-admin.argrx.edu")
                    (kdc "keys.argrx.edu"))))))
@end lisp

@noindent
This example provides a Kerberos@tie{}5 client configuration which:
@itemize
@item Recognizes two realms, @i{viz:} ``EXAMPLE.COM'' and ``ARGRX.EDU'', both
of which have distinct administration servers and key distribution centers;
@item Will default to the realm ``EXAMPLE.COM'' if the realm is not explicitly
specified by clients;
@item Accepts services which only support encryption types known to be weak.
@end itemize

The @code{krb5-realm} and @code{krb5-configuration} types have many fields.
Only the most commonly used ones are described here.
For a full list, and more detailed explanation of each, see the MIT
@uref{http://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-devel/doc/admin/conf_files/krb5_conf.html,,krb5.conf}
documentation.


@deftp {Data Type} krb5-realm
@cindex realm, kerberos
@table @asis
@item @code{name}
This field is a string identifying the name of the realm.
A common convention is to use the fully qualified DNS name of your organization,
converted to upper case.

@item @code{admin-server}
This field is a string identifying the host where the administration server is
running.

@item @code{kdc}
This field is a string identifying the key distribution center
for the realm.
@end table
@end deftp

@deftp {Data Type} krb5-configuration

@table @asis
@item @code{allow-weak-crypto?} (default: @code{#f})
If this flag is @code{#t} then services which only offer encryption algorithms
known to be weak will be accepted.

@item @code{default-realm} (default: @code{#f})
This field should be a string identifying the default Kerberos
realm for the client.
You should set this field to the name of your Kerberos realm.
If this value is @code{#f}
then a realm must be specified with every Kerberos principal when invoking programs
such as @command{kinit}.

@item @code{realms}
This should be a non-empty list of @code{krb5-realm} objects, which clients may
access.
Normally, one of them will have a @code{name} field matching the @code{default-realm}
field.
@end table
@end deftp


@subsubheading PAM krb5 Service
@cindex pam-krb5

The @code{pam-krb5} service allows for login authentication and password
management via Kerberos.
You will need this service if you want PAM enabled applications to authenticate
users using Kerberos.

@defvr {Scheme Variable} pam-krb5-service-type
A service type for the Kerberos 5 PAM module.
@end defvr

@deftp {Data Type} pam-krb5-configuration
Data type representing the configuration of the Kerberos 5 PAM module
This type has the following parameters:
@table @asis
@item @code{pam-krb5} (default: @code{pam-krb5})
The pam-krb5 package to use.

@item @code{minimum-uid} (default: @code{1000})
The smallest user ID for which Kerberos authentications should be attempted.
Local accounts with lower values will silently fail to authenticate.
@end table
@end deftp


@node LDAP Services
@subsection LDAP Services
@cindex LDAP
@cindex nslcd, LDAP service

The @code{(gnu services authentication)} module provides the
@code{nslcd-service-type}, which can be used to authenticate against an LDAP
server.  In addition to configuring the service itself, you may want to add
@code{ldap} as a name service to the Name Service Switch. @xref{Name Service
Switch} for detailed information.

Here is a simple operating system declaration with a default configuration of
the @code{nslcd-service-type} and a Name Service Switch configuration that
consults the @code{ldap} name service last:

@example
(use-service-modules authentication)
(use-modules (gnu system nss))
...
(operating-system
  ...
  (services
    (cons*
      (service nslcd-service-type)
      (service dhcp-client-service-type)
      %base-services))
  (name-service-switch
   (let ((services (list (name-service (name "db"))
                         (name-service (name "files"))
                         (name-service (name "ldap")))))
     (name-service-switch

@deftypevr {@code{nslcd-configuration} parameter} maybe-number nss-min-uid
This option ensures that LDAP users with a numeric user id lower than
the specified value are ignored.

Defaults to @samp{disabled}.

@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{nslcd-configuration} parameter} maybe-number nss-uid-offset
This option specifies an offset that is added to all LDAP numeric user
ids.  This can be used to avoid user id collisions with local users.

Defaults to @samp{disabled}.

@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{nslcd-configuration} parameter} maybe-number nss-gid-offset
This option specifies an offset that is added to all LDAP numeric group
ids.  This can be used to avoid user id collisions with local groups.

Defaults to @samp{disabled}.

@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{nslcd-configuration} parameter} maybe-boolean nss-nested-groups
If this option is set, the member attribute of a group may point to
another group.  Members of nested groups are also returned in the higher
level group and parent groups are returned when finding groups for a
specific user.  The default is not to perform extra searches for nested
groups.

Defaults to @samp{disabled}.

@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{nslcd-configuration} parameter} maybe-boolean nss-getgrent-skipmembers
If this option is set, the group member list is not retrieved when
looking up groups.  Lookups for finding which groups a user belongs to
will remain functional so the user will likely still get the correct
groups assigned on login.

Defaults to @samp{disabled}.

@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{nslcd-configuration} parameter} maybe-boolean nss-disable-enumeration
If this option is set, functions which cause all user/group entries to
be loaded from the directory will not succeed in doing so.  This can
dramatically reduce LDAP server load in situations where there are a
great number of users and/or groups.  This option is not recommended for
most configurations.

Defaults to @samp{disabled}.

@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{nslcd-configuration} parameter} maybe-string validnames
This option can be used to specify how user and group names are verified
within the system.  This pattern is used to check all user and group
names that are requested and returned from LDAP.

Defaults to @samp{disabled}.

@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{nslcd-configuration} parameter} maybe-boolean ignorecase
This specifies whether or not to perform searches using case-insensitive
matching.  Enabling this could open up the system to authorization
bypass vulnerabilities and introduce nscd cache poisoning
vulnerabilities which allow denial of service.

Defaults to @samp{disabled}.

@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{nslcd-configuration} parameter} maybe-boolean pam-authc-ppolicy
This option specifies whether password policy controls are requested and
handled from the LDAP server when performing user authentication.

Defaults to @samp{disabled}.

@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{nslcd-configuration} parameter} maybe-string pam-authc-search
By default nslcd performs an LDAP search with the user's credentials
after BIND (authentication) to ensure that the BIND operation was
successful.  The default search is a simple check to see if the user's
DN exists.  A search filter can be specified that will be used instead.
It should return at least one entry.

Defaults to @samp{disabled}.

@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{nslcd-configuration} parameter} maybe-string pam-authz-search
This option allows flexible fine tuning of the authorisation check that
should be performed.  The search filter specified is executed and if any
entries match, access is granted, otherwise access is denied.

Defaults to @samp{disabled}.

@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{nslcd-configuration} parameter} maybe-string pam-password-prohibit-message
If this option is set password modification using pam_ldap will be
denied and the specified message will be presented to the user instead.
The message can be used to direct the user to an alternative means of
changing their password.

Defaults to @samp{disabled}.

@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{nslcd-configuration} parameter} list pam-services
List of pam service names for which LDAP authentication should suffice.

Defaults to @samp{()}.

@end deftypevr

@node Web Services
@subsection Web Services

@cindex web
@cindex www
@cindex HTTP
The @code{(gnu services web)} module provides the Apache HTTP Server,
the nginx web server, and also a fastcgi wrapper daemon.

@subsubheading Apache HTTP Server

@deffn {Scheme Variable} httpd-service-type
Service type for the @uref{https://httpd.apache.org/,Apache HTTP} server
(@dfn{httpd}).  The value for this service type is a
@code{httpd-configuration} record.

A simple example configuration is given below.

@example
(service httpd-service-type
         (httpd-configuration
           (config
             (httpd-config-file
               (server-name "www.example.com")
               (document-root "/srv/http/www.example.com")))))
@end example

Other services can also extend the @code{httpd-service-type} to add to
the configuration.

@example
(simple-service 'my-extra-server httpd-service-type
                (list
                  (httpd-virtualhost
                    "*:80"
                    (list (string-append
                           "ServerName "www.example.com
                            DocumentRoot \"/srv/http/www.example.com\"")))))
@end example
@end deffn

The details for the @code{httpd-configuration}, @code{httpd-module},
@code{httpd-config-file} and @code{httpd-virtualhost} record types are
given below.

@deffn {Data Type} httpd-configuration
This data type represents the configuration for the httpd service.

@table @asis
@item @code{package} (default: @code{httpd})
The httpd package to use.

@item @code{pid-file} (default: @code{"/var/run/httpd"})
The pid file used by the shepherd-service.

@item @code{config} (default: @code{(httpd-config-file)})
The configuration file to use with the httpd service. The default value
is a @code{httpd-config-file} record, but this can also be a different
G-expression that generates a file, for example a @code{plain-file}. A
file outside of the store can also be specified through a string.

@end table
@end deffn

@deffn {Data Type} httpd-module
This data type represents a module for the httpd service.

@table @asis
@item @code{name}
The name of the module.

@item @code{file}
The file for the module. This can be relative to the httpd package being
used, the absolute location of a file, or a G-expression for a file
within the store, for example @code{(file-append mod-wsgi
"/modules/mod_wsgi.so")}.

@end table
@end deffn

@defvr {Scheme Variable} %default-httpd-modules
A default list of @code{httpd-module} objects.
@end defvr

@deffn {Data Type} httpd-config-file
This data type represents a configuration file for the httpd service.

@table @asis
@item @code{modules} (default: @code{%default-httpd-modules})
The modules to load. Additional modules can be added here, or loaded by
additional configuration.

For example, in order to handle requests for PHP files, you can use Apache’s
@code{mod_proxy_fcgi} module along with @code{php-fpm-service-type}:

@example
(service httpd-service-type
         (httpd-configuration
          (config
           (httpd-config-file
            (modules (cons*
                      (httpd-module
                       (name "proxy_module")
                       (file "modules/mod_proxy.so"))
                      (httpd-module
                       (name "proxy_fcgi_module")
                       (file "modules/mod_proxy_fcgi.so"))
                      %default-httpd-modules))
            (extra-config (list "\
<FilesMatch \\.php$>
    SetHandler \"proxy:unix:/var/run/php-fpm.sock|fcgi://localhost/\"
</FilesMatch>"))))))
(service php-fpm-service-type
         (php-fpm-configuration
          (socket "/var/run/php-fpm.sock")
          (socket-group "httpd")))
@end example

@item @code{server-root} (default: @code{httpd})
The @code{ServerRoot} in the configuration file, defaults to the httpd
package. Directives including @code{Include} and @code{LoadModule} are
taken as relative to the server root.

@item @code{server-name} (default: @code{#f})
The @code{ServerName} in the configuration file, used to specify the
request scheme, hostname and port that the server uses to identify
itself.

This doesn't need to be set in the server config, and can be specifyed
in virtual hosts. The default is @code{#f} to not specify a
@code{ServerName}.

@item @code{document-root} (default: @code{"/srv/http"})
The @code{DocumentRoot} from which files will be served.

@item @code{listen} (default: @code{'("80")})
The list of values for the @code{Listen} directives in the config
file. The value should be a list of strings, when each string can
specify the port number to listen on, and optionally the IP address and
protocol to use.

@item @code{pid-file} (default: @code{"/var/run/httpd"})
The @code{PidFile} to use. This should match the @code{pid-file} set in
the @code{httpd-configuration} so that the Shepherd service is
configured correctly.

@item @code{error-log} (default: @code{"/var/log/httpd/error_log"})
The @code{ErrorLog} to which the server will log errors.

@item @code{user} (default: @code{"httpd"})
The @code{User} which the server will answer requests as.

@item @code{group} (default: @code{"httpd"})
The @code{Group} which the server will answer requests as.

@item @code{extra-config} (default: @code{(list "TypesConfig etc/httpd/mime.types")})
A flat list of strings and G-expressions which will be added to the end
of the configuration file.

Any values which the service is extended with will be appended to this
list.

@end table
@end deffn

@deffn {Data Type} httpd-virtualhost
This data type represents a virtualhost configuration block for the httpd service.

These should be added to the extra-config for the httpd-service.

@example
(simple-service 'my-extra-server httpd-service-type
                (list
                  (httpd-virtualhost
                    "*:80"
                    (list (string-append
                           "ServerName "www.example.com
                            DocumentRoot \"/srv/http/www.example.com\"")))))
@end example

@table @asis
@item @code{addresses-and-ports}
The addresses and ports for the @code{VirtualHost} directive.

@item @code{contents}
The contents of the @code{VirtualHost} directive, this should be a list
of strings and G-expressions.

@end table
@end deffn

@subsubheading NGINX

@deffn {Scheme Variable} nginx-service-type
Service type for the @uref{https://nginx.org/,NGinx} web server.  The
value for this service type is a @code{<nginx-configuration>} record.

A simple example configuration is given below.

@example
(service nginx-service-type
         (nginx-configuration
           (server-blocks
             (list (nginx-server-configuration
                     (server-name '("www.example.com"))
                     (root "/srv/http/www.example.com"))))))
@end example

In addition to adding server blocks to the service configuration
directly, this service can be extended by other services to add server
blocks, as in this example:

@example
(simple-service 'my-extra-server nginx-service-type
                (list (nginx-server-configuration
                        (root "/srv/http/extra-website")
                        (try-files (list "$uri" "$uri/index.html")))))
@end example
@end deffn

At startup, @command{nginx} has not yet read its configuration file, so
it uses a default file to log error messages.  If it fails to load its
configuration file, that is where error messages are logged.  After the
configuration file is loaded, the default error log file changes as per
configuration.  In our case, startup error messages can be found in
@file{/var/run/nginx/logs/error.log}, and after configuration in
@file{/var/log/nginx/error.log}.  The second location can be changed
with the @var{log-directory} configuration option.

@deffn {Data Type} nginx-configuration
This data type represents the configuration for NGinx. Some
configuration can be done through this and the other provided record
types, or alternatively, a config file can be provided.

@table @asis
@item @code{nginx} (default: @code{nginx})
The nginx package to use.

@item @code{log-directory} (default: @code{"/var/log/nginx"})
The directory to which NGinx will write log files.

@item @code{run-directory} (default: @code{"/var/run/nginx"})
The directory in which NGinx will create a pid file, and write temporary
files.

@item @code{server-blocks} (default: @code{'()})
A list of @dfn{server blocks} to create in the generated configuration
file, the elements should be of type
@code{<nginx-server-configuration>}.

The following example would setup NGinx to serve @code{www.example.com}
from the @code{/srv/http/www.example.com} directory, without using
HTTPS.
@example
(service nginx-service-type
         (nginx-configuration
           (server-blocks
             (list (nginx-server-configuration
                     (server-name '("www.example.com"))
                     (root "/srv/http/www.example.com"))))))
@end example

@item @code{upstream-blocks} (default: @code{'()})
A list of @dfn{upstream blocks} to create in the generated configuration
file, the elements should be of type
@code{<nginx-upstream-configuration>}.

Configuring upstreams through the @code{upstream-blocks} can be useful
when combined with @code{locations} in the
@code{<nginx-server-configuration>} records.  The following example
creates a server configuration with one location configuration, that
will proxy requests to a upstream configuration, which will handle
requests with two servers.

@example
(service
  nginx-service-type
  (nginx-configuration
    (server-blocks
      (list (nginx-server-configuration
              (server-name '("www.example.com"))
              (root "/srv/http/www.example.com")
              (locations
                (list
                  (nginx-location-configuration
                  (uri "/path1")
                  (body '("proxy_pass http://server-proxy;"))))))))
    (upstream-blocks
      (list (nginx-upstream-configuration
              (name "server-proxy")
              (servers (list "server1.example.com"
                             "server2.example.com")))))))
@end example

@item @code{file} (default: @code{#f})
If a configuration @var{file} is provided, this will be used, rather than
generating a configuration file from the provided @code{log-directory},
@code{run-directory}, @code{server-blocks} and @code{upstream-blocks}.  For
proper operation, these arguments should match what is in @var{file} to ensure
that the directories are created when the service is activated.

This can be useful if you have an existing configuration file, or it's
not possible to do what is required through the other parts of the
nginx-configuration record.

@item @code{server-names-hash-bucket-size} (default: @code{#f})
Bucket size for the server names hash tables, defaults to @code{#f} to
use the size of the processors cache line.

@item @code{server-names-hash-bucket-max-size} (default: @code{#f})
Maximum bucket size for the server names hash tables.

@item @code{extra-content} (default: @code{""})
Extra content for the @code{http} block.  Should be string or a string
valued G-expression.

@deftp {Data Type} nginx-server-configuration
Data type representing the configuration of an nginx server block.
This type has the following parameters:

@table @asis
@item @code{listen} (default: @code{'("80" "443 ssl")})
Each @code{listen} directive sets the address and port for IP, or the
path for a UNIX-domain socket on which the server will accept requests.
Both address and port, or only address or only port can be specified.
An address may also be a hostname, for example:

@example
'("127.0.0.1:8000" "127.0.0.1" "8000" "*:8000" "localhost:8000")
@end example

@item @code{server-name} (default: @code{(list 'default)})

@item @code{locations} (default: @code{'()})
A list of @dfn{nginx-location-configuration} or
@dfn{nginx-named-location-configuration} records to use within this
server block.

@item @code{index} (default: @code{(list "index.html")})
Index files to look for when clients ask for a directory.  If it cannot be found,
Nginx will send the list of files in the directory.

@item @code{try-files} (default: @code{'()})
A list of files whose existence is checked in the specified order.
@code{nginx} will use the first file it finds to process the request.

@item @code{ssl-certificate} (default: @code{#f})
Where to find the certificate for secure connections.  Set it to @code{#f} if
you don't have a certificate or you don't want to use HTTPS.

you don't have a key or you don't want to use HTTPS.

@item @code{server-tokens?} (default: @code{#f})
Whether the server should add its configuration to response.

@item @code{raw-content} (default: @code{'()})
A list of raw lines added to the server block.

@end table
@end deftp

@deftp {Data Type} nginx-upstream-configuration
Data type representing the configuration of an nginx @code{upstream}
block.  This type has the following parameters:

@table @asis
@item @code{name}
Name for this group of servers.

@item @code{servers}
Specify the addresses of the servers in the group.  The address can be
specified as a IP address (e.g.@: @samp{127.0.0.1}), domain name
(e.g.@: @samp{backend1.example.com}) or a path to a UNIX socket using the
prefix @samp{unix:}.  For addresses using an IP address or domain name,
the default port is 80, and a different port can be specified
explicitly.

@end table
@end deftp

@deftp {Data Type} nginx-location-configuration
Data type representing the configuration of an nginx @code{location}
block.  This type has the following parameters:

@table @asis
@item @code{uri}
URI which this location block matches.

@anchor{nginx-location-configuration body}
@item @code{body}
Body of the location block, specified as a list of strings. This can contain
many
configuration directives.  For example, to pass requests to a upstream
server group defined using an @code{nginx-upstream-configuration} block,
the following directive would be specified in the body @samp{(list "proxy_pass
http://upstream-name;")}.

@end table
@end deftp

@deftp {Data Type} nginx-named-location-configuration
Data type representing the configuration of an nginx named location
block.  Named location blocks are used for request redirection, and not
used for regular request processing.  This type has the following
parameters:

@table @asis
@item @code{name}
Name to identify this location block.

@item @code{body}
@xref{nginx-location-configuration body}, as the body for named location
blocks can be used in a similar way to the
@code{nginx-location-configuration body}.  One restriction is that the
body of a named location block cannot contain location blocks.

@end table
@end deftp

@subsubheading Varnish Cache
@cindex Varnish
Varnish is a fast cache server that sits in between web applications
and end users.  It proxies requests from clients and caches the
accessed URLs such that multiple requests for the same resource only
creates one request to the back-end.

@defvr {Scheme Variable} varnish-service-type
Service type for the Varnish daemon.
@end defvr

@deftp {Data Type} varnish-configuration
Data type representing the @code{varnish} service configuration.
This type has the following parameters:

@table @asis
@item @code{package} (default: @code{varnish})
The Varnish package to use.

@item @code{name} (default: @code{"default"})
A name for this Varnish instance.  Varnish will create a directory in
@file{/var/varnish/} with this name and keep temporary files there.  If
the name starts with a forward slash, it is interpreted as an absolute
directory name.

Pass the @code{-n} argument to other Varnish programs to connect to the
named instance, e.g.@: @command{varnishncsa -n default}.

@item @code{backend} (default: @code{"localhost:8080"})
The backend to use.  This option has no effect if @code{vcl} is set.

@item @code{vcl} (default: #f)
The @dfn{VCL} (Varnish Configuration Language) program to run.  If this
is @code{#f}, Varnish will proxy @code{backend} using the default
configuration.  Otherwise this must be a file-like object with valid
VCL syntax.

@c Varnish does not support HTTPS, so keep this URL to avoid confusion.
For example, to mirror @url{http://www.gnu.org,www.gnu.org} with VCL you
can do something along these lines:

@example
(define %gnu-mirror
  (plain-file
   "gnu.vcl"
   "vcl 4.1;
backend gnu @{ .host = "www.gnu.org"; @}"))

(operating-system
  ...
  (services (cons (service varnish-service-type
                           (varnish-configuration
                            (listen '(":80"))
                            (vcl %gnu-mirror)))
                  %base-services)))
@end example

The configuration of an already running Varnish instance can be inspected
and changed using the @command{varnishadm} program.

Consult the @url{https://varnish-cache.org/docs/,Varnish User Guide} and
@url{https://book.varnish-software.com/4.0/,Varnish Book} for
comprehensive documentation on Varnish and its configuration language.

@item @code{listen} (default: @code{'("localhost:80")})
List of addresses Varnish will listen on.

@item @code{storage} (default: @code{'("malloc,128m")})
List of storage backends that will be available in VCL.

@item @code{parameters} (default: @code{'()})
List of run-time parameters in the form @code{'(("parameter" . "value"))}.

@item @code{extra-options} (default: @code{'()})
Additional arguments to pass to the @command{varnishd} process.

@end table
@end deftp

@subsubheading FastCGI
@cindex fastcgi
@cindex fcgiwrap
FastCGI is an interface between the front-end and the back-end of a web
service.  It is a somewhat legacy facility; new web services should
generally just talk HTTP between the front-end and the back-end.
However there are a number of back-end services such as PHP or the
optimized HTTP Git repository access that use FastCGI, so we have
support for it in Guix.

To use FastCGI, you configure the front-end web server (e.g., nginx) to
dispatch some subset of its requests to the fastcgi backend, which
listens on a local TCP or UNIX socket.  There is an intermediary
@code{fcgiwrap} program that sits between the actual backend process and
the web server.  The front-end indicates which backend program to run,
passing that information to the @code{fcgiwrap} process.

@defvr {Scheme Variable} fcgiwrap-service-type
A service type for the @code{fcgiwrap} FastCGI proxy.
@end defvr

@deftp {Data Type} fcgiwrap-configuration
Data type representing the configuration of the @code{fcgiwrap} service.
This type has the following parameters:
@table @asis
@item @code{package} (default: @code{fcgiwrap})
The fcgiwrap package to use.

@item @code{socket} (default: @code{tcp:127.0.0.1:9000})
The socket on which the @code{fcgiwrap} process should listen, as a
string.  Valid @var{socket} values include
@code{unix:@var{/path/to/unix/socket}},
@code{tcp:@var{dot.ted.qu.ad}:@var{port}} and
@code{tcp6:[@var{ipv6_addr}]:port}.

@item @code{user} (default: @code{fcgiwrap})
@itemx @code{group} (default: @code{fcgiwrap})
The user and group names, as strings, under which to run the
@code{fcgiwrap} process.  The @code{fastcgi} service will ensure that if
the user asks for the specific user or group names @code{fcgiwrap} that
the corresponding user and/or group is present on the system.

It is possible to configure a FastCGI-backed web service to pass HTTP
authentication information from the front-end to the back-end, and to
allow @code{fcgiwrap} to run the back-end process as a corresponding
local user.  To enable this capability on the back-end., run
@code{fcgiwrap} as the @code{root} user and group.  Note that this
capability also has to be configured on the front-end as well.
@end table
@end deftp

@cindex php-fpm
PHP-FPM (FastCGI Process Manager) is an alternative PHP FastCGI implementation
with some additional features useful for sites of any size.

These features include:
@itemize @bullet
@item Adaptive process spawning
@item Basic statistics (similar to Apache's mod_status)
@item Advanced process management with graceful stop/start
@item Ability to start workers with different uid/gid/chroot/environment
and different php.ini (replaces safe_mode)

@end example

@quotation Note
The hpcguix-web service periodically updates the package list it publishes by
pulling channels from Git.  To that end, it needs to access X.509 certificates
so that it can authenticate Git servers when communicating over HTTPS, and it
assumes that @file{/etc/ssl/certs} contains those certificates.

Thus, make sure to add @code{nss-certs} or another certificate package to the
@code{packages} field of your configuration.  @ref{X.509 Certificates}, for
more information on X.509 certificates.
@end quotation

@node Certificate Services
@subsection Certificate Services

@cindex Web
@cindex HTTP, HTTPS
@cindex Let's Encrypt
@cindex TLS certificates
The @code{(gnu services certbot)} module provides a service to
automatically obtain a valid TLS certificate from the Let's Encrypt
certificate authority.  These certificates can then be used to serve
content securely over HTTPS or other TLS-based protocols, with the
knowledge that the client will be able to verify the server's
authenticity.

@url{https://letsencrypt.org/, Let's Encrypt} provides the
@code{certbot} tool to automate the certification process.  This tool
first securely generates a key on the server.  It then makes a request
to the Let's Encrypt certificate authority (CA) to sign the key.  The CA
checks that the request originates from the host in question by using a
challenge-response protocol, requiring the server to provide its
response over HTTP.  If that protocol completes successfully, the CA
signs the key, resulting in a certificate.  That certificate is valid
for a limited period of time, and therefore to continue to provide TLS
services, the server needs to periodically ask the CA to renew its
signature.

The certbot service automates this process: the initial key
generation, the initial certification request to the Let's Encrypt
service, the web server challenge/response integration, writing the
certificate to disk, the automated periodic renewals, and the deployment
tasks associated with the renewal (e.g.@: reloading services, copying keys
with different permissions).

Certbot is run twice a day, at a random minute within the hour.  It
won't do anything until your certificates are due for renewal or
revoked, but running it regularly would give your service a chance of
staying online in case a Let's Encrypt-initiated revocation happened for
some reason.

By using this service, you agree to the ACME Subscriber Agreement, which
can be found there:
@url{https://acme-v01.api.letsencrypt.org/directory}.

@defvr {Scheme Variable} certbot-service-type
A service type for the @code{certbot} Let's Encrypt client.  Its value
must be a @code{certbot-configuration} record as in this example:

@example
(define %nginx-deploy-hook
  (program-file
   "nginx-deploy-hook"
   #~(let ((pid (call-with-input-file "/var/run/nginx/pid" read)))
       (kill pid SIGHUP))))

(service certbot-service-type
         (certbot-configuration
          (email "foo@@example.net")
          (certificates
           (list
            (certificate-configuration
             (domains '("example.net" "www.example.net"))
             (deploy-hook %nginx-deploy-hook))
            (certificate-configuration
             (domains '("bar.example.net")))))))
@end example

See below for details about @code{certbot-configuration}.
@end defvr

@deftp {Data Type} certbot-configuration
Data type representing the configuration of the @code{certbot} service.
This type has the following parameters:

@table @asis
@item @code{package} (default: @code{certbot})
The certbot package to use.

@item @code{webroot} (default: @code{/var/www})
The directory from which to serve the Let's Encrypt challenge/response
files.

@item @code{certificates} (default: @code{()})
A list of @code{certificates-configuration}s for which to generate
certificates and request signatures.  Each certificate has a @code{name}
and several @code{domains}.

@item @code{email}
Mandatory email used for registration, recovery contact, and important
account notifications.

@item @code{rsa-key-size} (default: @code{2048})
Size of the RSA key.

@item @code{default-location} (default: @i{see below})
The default @code{nginx-location-configuration}.  Because @code{certbot}
needs to be able to serve challenges and responses, it needs to be able
to run a web server.  It does so by extending the @code{nginx} web
service with an @code{nginx-server-configuration} listening on the
@var{domains} on port 80, and which has a
@code{nginx-location-configuration} for the @code{/.well-known/} URI
path subspace used by Let's Encrypt.  @xref{Web Services}, for more on
these nginx configuration data types.

Requests to other URL paths will be matched by the
@code{default-location}, which if present is added to all
@code{nginx-server-configuration}s.

By default, the @code{default-location} will issue a redirect from
@code{http://@var{domain}/...} to @code{https://@var{domain}/...}, leaving
you to define what to serve on your site via @code{https}.

Pass @code{#f} to not issue a default location.
@end table
@end deftp

@deftp {Data Type} certificate-configuration
Data type representing the configuration of a certificate.
This type has the following parameters:

@table @asis
@item @code{name} (default: @i{see below})
This name is used by Certbot for housekeeping and in file paths; it
doesn't affect the content of the certificate itself.  To see
certificate names, run @code{certbot certificates}.

Its default is the first provided domain.

@item @code{domains} (default: @code{()})
The first domain provided will be the subject CN of the certificate, and
all domains will be Subject Alternative Names on the certificate.

@item @code{deploy-hook} (default: @code{#f})
Command to be run in a shell once for each successfully issued
certificate.  For this command, the shell variable
@code{$RENEWED_LINEAGE} will point to the config live subdirectory (for
example, @samp{"/etc/letsencrypt/live/example.com"}) containing the new
certificates and keys; the shell variable @code{$RENEWED_DOMAINS} will
contain a space-delimited list of renewed certificate domains (for
example, @samp{"example.com www.example.com"}.

@end table
@end deftp

For each @code{certificate-configuration}, the certificate is saved to
@code{/etc/letsencrypt/live/@var{name}/fullchain.pem} and the key is
saved to @code{/etc/letsencrypt/live/@var{name}/privkey.pem}.
@node DNS Services
@subsection DNS Services

@cindex domain name system (DNS)

The @code{(gnu services dns)} module provides services related to the
@dfn{domain name system} (DNS).  It provides a server service for hosting
an @emph{authoritative} DNS server for multiple zones, slave or master.
This service uses @uref{https://www.knot-dns.cz/, Knot DNS}.  And also a

                   %base-services)))
@end lisp

@deffn {Scheme Variable} knot-service-type
This is the type for the Knot DNS server.

Knot DNS is an authoritative DNS server, meaning that it can serve multiple
zones, that is to say domain names you would buy from a registrar.  This server
is not a resolver, meaning that it can only resolve names for which it is
authoritative.  This server can be configured to serve zones as a master server
or a slave server as a per-zone basis.  Slave zones will get their data from
masters, and will serve it as an authoritative server.  From the point of view
of a resolver, there is no difference between master and slave.

The following data types are used to configure the Knot DNS server:
@end deffn

@deftp {Data Type} knot-key-configuration
Data type representing a key.
This type has the following parameters:

@table @asis
@item @code{id} (default: @code{""})
An identifier for other configuration fields to refer to this key. IDs must
be unique and must not be empty.

@item @code{algorithm} (default: @code{#f})
The algorithm to use.  Choose between @code{#f}, @code{'hmac-md5},
@code{'hmac-sha1}, @code{'hmac-sha224}, @code{'hmac-sha256}, @code{'hmac-sha384}
and @code{'hmac-sha512}.

@item @code{secret} (default: @code{""})
The secret key itself.

@end table
@end deftp

@deftp {Data Type} knot-acl-configuration
Data type representing an Access Control List (ACL) configuration.
This type has the following parameters:

@table @asis
@item @code{id} (default: @code{""})
An identifier for ether configuration fields to refer to this key. IDs must be
unique and must not be empty.

@item @code{address} (default: @code{'()})
An ordered list of IP addresses, network subnets, or network ranges represented
with strings.  The query must match one of them.  Empty value means that
address match is not required.

@item @code{key} (default: @code{'()})
An ordered list of references to keys represented with strings.  The string
must match a key ID defined in a @code{knot-key-configuration}.  No key means
that a key is not require to match that ACL.

@item @code{action} (default: @code{'()})
An ordered list of actions that are permitted or forbidden by this ACL.  Possible
values are lists of zero or more elements from @code{'transfer}, @code{'notify}
and @code{'update}.

@item @code{deny?} (default: @code{#f})
When true, the ACL defines restrictions.  Listed actions are forbidden.  When
false, listed actions are allowed.

@end table
@end deftp

@deftp {Data Type} zone-entry
Data type represnting a record entry in a zone file.
This type has the following parameters:

@table @asis
@item @code{name} (default: @code{"@@"})
The name of the record.  @code{"@@"} refers to the origin of the zone.  Names
are relative to the origin of the zone.  For example, in the @code{example.org}
zone, @code{"ns.example.org"} actually refers to @code{ns.example.org.example.org}.
Names ending with a dot are absolute, which means that @code{"ns.example.org."}
refers to @code{ns.example.org}.

@item @code{ttl} (default: @code{""})
The Time-To-Live (TTL) of this record.  If not set, the default TTL is used.

@item @code{class} (default: @code{"IN"})
The class of the record.  Knot currently supports only @code{"IN"} and
partially @code{"CH"}.

@item @code{type} (default: @code{"A"})
The type of the record.  Common types include A (IPv4 address), AAAA (IPv6
address), NS (Name Server) and MX (Mail eXchange).  Many other types are
defined.

@item @code{data} (default: @code{""})
The data contained in the record.  For instance an IP address associated with
an A record, or a domain name associated with an NS record.  Remember that
domain names are relative to the origin unless they end with a dot.

@end table
@end deftp

@deftp {Data Type} zone-file
Data type representing the content of a zone file.
This type has the following parameters:

@table @asis
@item @code{entries} (default: @code{'()})
The list of entries.  The SOA record is taken care of, so you don't need to
put it in the list of entries.  This list should probably contain an entry
for your primary authoritative DNS server.  Other than using a list of entries
directly, you can use @code{define-zone-entries} to define a object containing
the list of entries more easily, that you can later pass to the @code{entries}
field of the @code{zone-file}.

@item @code{origin} (default: @code{""})
The name of your zone.  This parameter cannot be empty.

@item @code{ns} (default: @code{"ns"})
The domain of your primary authoritative DNS server.  The name is relative to
the origin, unless it ends with a dot.  It is mandatory that this primary
DNS server corresponds to an NS record in the zone and that it is associated
to an IP address in the list of entries.

@item @code{mail} (default: @code{"hostmaster"})
An email address people can contact you at, as the owner of the zone.  This
is translated as @code{<mail>@@<origin>}.

@item @code{serial} (default: @code{1})
The serial number of the zone.  As this is used to keep track of changes by
both slaves and resolvers, it is mandatory that it @emph{never} decreases.
Always increment it when you make a change in your zone.

@item @code{refresh} (default: @code{(* 2 24 3600)})
The frequency at which slaves will do a zone transfer.  This value is a number
of seconds.  It can be computed by multiplications or with
@code{(string->duration)}.

@item @code{retry} (default: @code{(* 15 60)})
The period after which a slave will retry to contact its master when it fails
to do so a first time.

@item @code{expiry} (default: @code{(* 14 24 3600)})
Default TTL of records.  Existing records are considered correct for at most
this amount of time.  After this period, resolvers will invalidate their cache
and check again that it still exists.

@item @code{nx} (default: @code{3600})
Default TTL of inexistant records.  This delay is usually short because you want
your new domains to reach everyone quickly.

@end table
@end deftp

@deftp {Data Type} knot-remote-configuration
Data type representing a remote configuration.
This type has the following parameters:

@table @asis
@item @code{id} (default: @code{""})
An identifier for other configuration fields to refer to this remote. IDs must
be unique and must not be empty.

@item @code{address} (default: @code{'()})
An ordered list of destination IP addresses.  Addresses are tried in sequence.
An optional port can be given with the @@ separator.  For instance:
@code{(list "1.2.3.4" "2.3.4.5@@53")}.  Default port is 53.

@item @code{via} (default: @code{'()})
An ordered list of source IP addresses.  An empty list will have Knot choose
an appropriate source IP.  An optional port can be given with the @@ separator.
The default is to choose at random.

@item @code{key} (default: @code{#f})
A reference to a key, that is a string containing the identifier of a key
defined in a @code{knot-key-configuration} field.

@end table
@end deftp

@deftp {Data Type} knot-keystore-configuration
Data type representing a keystore to hold dnssec keys.
This type has the following parameters:

@table @asis
@item @code{id} (default: @code{""})
The id of the keystore.  It must not be empty.

@item @code{backend} (default: @code{'pem})
The backend to store the keys in.  Can be @code{'pem} or @code{'pkcs11}.

@item @code{config} (default: @code{"/var/lib/knot/keys/keys"})
The configuration string of the backend.  An example for the PKCS#11 is:
@code{"pkcs11:token=knot;pin-value=1234 /gnu/store/.../lib/pkcs11/libsofthsm2.so"}.
For the pem backend, the string reprensents a path in the file system.

@end table
@end deftp

@deftp {Data Type} knot-policy-configuration
Data type representing a dnssec policy.  Knot DNS is able to automatically
sign your zones.  It can either generate and manage your keys automatically or
use keys that you generate.

Dnssec is usually implemented using two keys: a Key Signing Key (KSK) that is
used to sign the second, and a Zone Signing Key (ZSK) that is used to sign the
zone.  In order to be trusted, the KSK needs to be present in the parent zone
(usually a top-level domain).  If your registrar supports dnssec, you will
have to send them your KSK's hash so they can add a DS record in their zone.
This is not automated and need to be done each time you change your KSK.

The policy also defines the lifetime of keys.  Usually, ZSK can be changed
easily and use weaker cryptographic functions (they use lower parameters) in
order to sign records quickly, so they are changed often.  The KSK however
requires manual interaction with the registrar, so they are changed less often
and use stronger parameters because they sign only one record.

which are most commonly used in relation to mounting or exporting
directory trees as @dfn{network file systems} (NFS).

@subsubheading RPC Bind Service
@cindex rpcbind

The RPC Bind service provides a facility to map program numbers into
universal addresses.
Many NFS related services use this facility.  Hence it is automatically
started when a dependent service starts.

@node Power Management Services
@subsection Power Management Services

@cindex tlp
@cindex power management with TLP
@subsubheading TLP daemon

The @code{(gnu services pm)} module provides a Guix service definition
for the Linux power management tool TLP.

TLP enables various powersaving modes in userspace and kernel.
Contrary to @code{upower-service}, it is not a passive,
monitoring tool, as it will apply custom settings each time a new power
source is detected.  More information can be found at
@uref{http://linrunner.de/en/tlp/tlp.html, TLP home page}.

@deffn {Scheme Variable} tlp-service-type
The service type for the TLP tool.  Its value should be a valid
TLP configuration (see below).  To use the default settings, simply
write:
@example
(service tlp-service-type)
@end example
@end deffn

By default TLP does not need much configuration but most TLP parameters
can be tweaked using @code{tlp-configuration}.

Each parameter definition is preceded by its type; for example,
@samp{boolean foo} indicates that the @code{foo} parameter
should be specified as a boolean.  Types starting with
@code{maybe-} denote parameters that won't show up in TLP config file
when their value is @code{'disabled}.

@c The following documentation was initially generated by
@c (generate-tlp-documentation) in (gnu services pm).  Manually maintained
@c documentation is better, so we shouldn't hesitate to edit below as
@c needed.  However if the change you want to make to this documentation
@c can be done in an automated way, it's probably easier to change
@c (generate-documentation) than to make it below and have to deal with
@c the churn as TLP updates.

@deftypevr {@code{libvirt-configuration} parameter} string log-filters
Logging filters.

A filter allows to select a different logging level for a given category
of logs The format for a filter is one of:

@itemize @bullet
@item
x:name

@item
x:+name

@end itemize

where @code{name} is a string which is matched against the category
given in the @code{VIR_LOG_INIT()} at the top of each libvirt source
file, e.g., "remote", "qemu", or "util.json" (the name in the filter can
be a substring of the full category name, in order to match multiple
similar categories), the optional "+" prefix tells libvirt to log stack
trace for each message matching name, and @code{x} is the minimal level
where matching messages should be logged:

@itemize @bullet
@item
1: DEBUG

@item
2: INFO

@item
3: WARNING

@item
4: ERROR

@end itemize

Multiple filters can be defined in a single filters statement, they just
need to be separated by spaces.

Defaults to @samp{"3:remote 4:event"}.

@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{libvirt-configuration} parameter} string log-outputs
Logging outputs.

An output is one of the places to save logging information The format
for an output can be:

@table @code
@item x:stderr
output goes to stderr

@item x:syslog:name
use syslog for the output and use the given name as the ident

@item x:file:file_path
output to a file, with the given filepath

If @code{dmidecode} does not provide a valid UUID a temporary UUID will
be generated.

Defaults to @samp{"smbios"}.

@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{libvirt-configuration} parameter} integer keepalive-interval
A keepalive message is sent to a client after @code{keepalive_interval}
seconds of inactivity to check if the client is still responding.  If
set to -1, libvirtd will never send keepalive requests; however clients
can still send them and the daemon will send responses.

Defaults to @samp{5}.

@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{libvirt-configuration} parameter} integer keepalive-count
Maximum number of keepalive messages that are allowed to be sent to the
client without getting any response before the connection is considered
broken.

In other words, the connection is automatically closed approximately
after @code{keepalive_interval * (keepalive_count + 1)} seconds since
the last message received from the client.  When @code{keepalive-count}
is set to 0, connections will be automatically closed after
@code{keepalive-interval} seconds of inactivity without sending any
keepalive messages.

Defaults to @samp{5}.

@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{libvirt-configuration} parameter} integer admin-keepalive-interval

@subsubheading Virtlog daemon
The virtlogd service is a server side daemon component of libvirt that is
used to manage logs from virtual machine consoles.

This daemon is not used directly by libvirt client applications, rather it
is called on their behalf by @code{libvirtd}. By maintaining the logs in a
standalone daemon, the main @code{libvirtd} daemon can be restarted without
risk of losing logs. The @code{virtlogd} daemon has the ability to re-exec()
itself upon receiving @code{SIGUSR1}, to allow live upgrades without downtime.

@deffn {Scheme Variable} virtlog-service-type
This is the type of the virtlog daemon.

@subsubheading Transparent Emulation with QEMU

@cindex emulation
@cindex @code{binfmt_misc}
@code{qemu-binfmt-service-type} provides support for transparent
emulation of program binaries built for different architectures---e.g.,
it allows you to transparently execute an ARMv7 program on an x86_64
machine.  It achieves this by combining the @uref{https://www.qemu.org,
QEMU} emulator and the @code{binfmt_misc} feature of the kernel Linux.

@defvr {Scheme Variable} qemu-binfmt-service-type
This is the type of the QEMU/binfmt service for transparent emulation.
Its value must be a @code{qemu-binfmt-configuration} object, which
specifies the QEMU package to use as well as the architecture we want to
emulated:

@example
(service qemu-binfmt-service-type
         (qemu-binfmt-configuration
           (platforms (lookup-qemu-platforms "arm" "aarch64" "mips64el"))))
@end example

In this example, we enable transparent emulation for the ARM and aarch64
platforms.  Running @code{herd stop qemu-binfmt} turns it off, and
running @code{herd start qemu-binfmt} turns it back on (@pxref{Invoking
herd, the @command{herd} command,, shepherd, The GNU Shepherd Manual}).
@end defvr

@deftp {Data Type} qemu-binfmt-configuration
This is the configuration for the @code{qemu-binfmt} service.

@table @asis
@item @code{platforms} (default: @code{'()})
The list of emulated QEMU platforms.  Each item must be a @dfn{platform
object} as returned by @code{lookup-qemu-platforms} (see below).

@item @code{guix-support?} (default: @code{#f})
When it is true, QEMU and all its dependencies are added to the build
environment of @command{guix-daemon} (@pxref{Invoking guix-daemon,
@code{--chroot-directory} option}).  This allows the @code{binfmt_misc}
handlers to be used within the build environment, which in turn means
that you can transparently build programs for another architecture.

For example, let's suppose you're on an x86_64 machine and you have this
service:

@example
(service qemu-binfmt-service-type
         (qemu-binfmt-configuration
           (platforms (lookup-qemu-platforms "arm"))
           (guix-support? #t)))
@end example

You can run:

@example
guix build -s armhf-linux inkscape
@end example

@noindent
and it will build Inkscape for ARMv7 @emph{as if it were a native
build}, transparently using QEMU to emulate the ARMv7 CPU.  Pretty handy
if you'd like to test a package build for an architecture you don't have
access to!

@item @code{qemu} (default: @code{qemu})
The QEMU package to use.
@end table
@end deftp

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} lookup-qemu-platforms @var{platforms}@dots{}
Return the list of QEMU platform objects corresponding to
@var{platforms}@dots{}.  @var{platforms} must be a list of strings
corresponding to platform names, such as @code{"arm"}, @code{"sparc"},
@code{"mips64el"}, and so on.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} qemu-platform? @var{obj}
Return true if @var{obj} is a platform object.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} qemu-platform-name @var{platform}
Return the name of @var{platform}---a string such as @code{"arm"}.
@end deffn

@node Version Control Services
@subsection Version Control Services

The @code{(gnu services version-control)} module provides a service to
allow remote access to local Git repositories.  There are three options:
the @code{git-daemon-service}, which provides access to repositories via
the @code{git://} unsecured TCP-based protocol, extending the
@code{nginx} web server to proxy some requests to
@code{git-http-backend}, or providing a web interface with
@code{cgit-service-type}.

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} git-daemon-service [#:config (git-daemon-configuration)]

Return a service that runs @command{git daemon}, a simple TCP server to
expose repositories over the Git protocol for anonymous access.

The optional @var{config} argument should be a
@code{<git-daemon-configuration>} object, by default it allows read-only
access to exported@footnote{By creating the magic file
"git-daemon-export-ok" in the repository directory.} repositories under
@file{/srv/git}.

@end deffn

@deftp {Data Type} git-daemon-configuration
Data type representing the configuration for @code{git-daemon-service}.

@table @asis
@item @code{package} (default: @var{git})
Package object of the Git distributed version control system.

@item @code{export-all?} (default: @var{#f})
Whether to allow access for all Git repositories, even if they do not
have the @file{git-daemon-export-ok} file.

@item @code{base-path} (default: @file{/srv/git})
Whether to remap all the path requests as relative to the given path.
If you run git daemon with @var{(base-path "/srv/git")} on example.com,
then if you later try to pull @code{git://example.com/hello.git}, git
daemon will interpret the path as @code{/srv/git/hello.git}.

@item @code{user-path} (default: @var{#f})
Whether to allow @code{~user} notation to be used in requests.  When
specified with empty string, requests to @code{git://host/~alice/foo} is
taken as a request to access @code{foo} repository in the home directory
of user @code{alice}.  If @var{(user-path "path")} is specified, the
same request is taken as a request to access @code{path/foo} repository
in the home directory of user @code{alice}.

@item @code{listen} (default: @var{'()})
Whether to listen on specific IP addresses or hostnames, defaults to
all.

@item @code{port} (default: @var{#f})
Whether to listen on an alternative port, which defaults to 9418.

@item @code{whitelist} (default: @var{'()})
If not empty, only allow access to this list of directories.

@item @code{extra-options} (default: @var{'()})
Extra options will be passed to @code{git daemon}, please run
@command{man git-daemon} for more information.

@end table
@end deftp

The @code{git://} protocol lacks authentication.  When you pull from a
repository fetched via @code{git://}, you don't know that the data you
receive was modified is really coming from the specified host, and you
have your connection is subject to eavesdropping.  It's better to use an
authenticated and encrypted transport, such as @code{https}.  Although Git allows you
to serve repositories using unsophisticated file-based web servers,
there is a faster protocol implemented by the @code{git-http-backend}
program.  This program is the back-end of a proper Git web service.  It
is designed to sit behind a FastCGI proxy.  @xref{Web Services}, for more
on running the necessary @code{fcgiwrap} daemon.

Guix has a separate configuration data type for serving Git repositories
over HTTP.

@deftp {Data Type} git-http-configuration
Data type representing the configuration for @code{git-http-service}.

@table @asis
@item @code{package} (default: @var{git})
Package object of the Git distributed version control system.

@item @code{git-root} (default: @file{/srv/git})
Directory containing the Git repositories to expose to the world.

@item @code{export-all?} (default: @var{#f})
Whether to expose access for all Git repositories in @var{git-root},
even if they do not have the @file{git-daemon-export-ok} file.

@item @code{uri-path} (default: @file{/git/})
Path prefix for Git access.  With the default @code{/git/} prefix, this
will map @code{http://@var{server}/git/@var{repo}.git} to
@code{/srv/git/@var{repo}.git}.  Requests whose URI paths do not begin
with this prefix are not passed on to this Git instance.

@item @code{fcgiwrap-socket} (default: @code{127.0.0.1:9000})
The socket on which the @code{fcgiwrap} daemon is listening.  @xref{Web
Services}.
@end table
@end deftp

There is no @code{git-http-service-type}, currently; instead you can
create an @code{nginx-location-configuration} from a
@code{git-http-configuration} and then add that location to a web
server.

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} git-http-nginx-location-configuration @
       [config=(git-http-configuration)]
Compute an @code{nginx-location-configuration} that corresponds to the
given Git http configuration.  An example nginx service definition to
serve the default @file{/srv/git} over HTTPS might be:

@example
(service nginx-service-type
         (nginx-configuration
          (server-blocks
           (list
            (nginx-server-configuration
             (listen '("443 ssl"))
             (server-name "git.my-host.org")
             (ssl-certificate
              "/etc/letsencrypt/live/git.my-host.org/fullchain.pem")
             (ssl-certificate-key
              "/etc/letsencrypt/live/git.my-host.org/privkey.pem")
             (locations
              (list
               (git-http-nginx-location-configuration
                (git-http-configuration (uri-path "/"))))))))))
@end example

This example assumes that you are using Let's Encrypt to get your TLS
certificate.  @xref{Certificate Services}.  The default @code{certbot}
service will redirect all HTTP traffic on @code{git.my-host.org} to
HTTPS.  You will also need to add an @code{fcgiwrap} proxy to your
system services.  @xref{Web Services}.

However, it could be that you just want to get a @code{cgitrc} up and
running.  In that case, you can pass an @code{opaque-cgit-configuration}
as a record to @code{cgit-service-type}.  As its name indicates, an
opaque configuration does not have easy reflective capabilities.

Available @code{opaque-cgit-configuration} fields are:

@deftypevr {@code{opaque-cgit-configuration} parameter} package cgit
The cgit package.
@end deftypevr

@deftypevr {@code{opaque-cgit-configuration} parameter} string string
The contents of the @code{cgitrc}, as a string.
@end deftypevr

For example, if your @code{cgitrc} is just the empty string, you
could instantiate a cgit service like this:

@example
(service cgit-service-type
         (opaque-cgit-configuration
          (cgitrc "")))
@end example

@subsubheading Gitolite Service

@cindex Gitolite service
@cindex Git, hosting
@uref{http://gitolite.com/gitolite/, Gitolite} is a tool for hosting Git
repositories on a central server.

Gitolite can handle multiple repositories and users, and supports flexible
configuration of the permissions for the users on the repositories.

The following example will configure Gitolite using the default @code{git}
user, and the provided SSH public key.

@example
(service gitolite-service-type
         (gitolite-configuration
           (admin-pubkey (plain-file
                           "yourname.pub"
                           "ssh-rsa AAAA... guix@@example.com"))))
@end example

Gitolite is configured through a special admin repository which you can clone,
for example, if you setup Gitolite on @code{example.com}, you would run the
following command to clone the admin repository.

@example
git clone git@@example.com:gitolite-admin
@end example

When the Gitolite service is activated, the provided @code{admin-pubkey} will
be inserted in to the @file{keydir} directory in the gitolite-admin
repository.  If this results in a change in the repository, it will be
committed using the message ``gitolite setup by GNU Guix''.

@deftp {Data Type} gitolite-configuration
Data type representing the configuration for @code{gitolite-service-type}.

@table @asis
@item @code{package} (default: @var{gitolite})
Gitolite package to use.

@item @code{user} (default: @var{git})
User to use for Gitolite.  This will be user that you use when accessing
Gitolite over SSH.

@item @code{group} (default: @var{git})
Group to use for Gitolite.

@item @code{home-directory} (default: @var{"/var/lib/gitolite"})
Directory in which to store the Gitolite configuration and repositories.

@item @code{admin-pubkey} (default: @var{#f})
A ``file-like'' object (@pxref{G-Expressions, file-like objects}) used to
setup Gitolite.  This will be inserted in to the @file{keydir} directory
within the gitolite-admin repository.

To specify the SSH key as a string, use the @code{plain-file} function.

@example
(plain-file "yourname.pub" "ssh-rsa AAAA... guix@@example.com")
@end example

@end table
@end deftp

@deftp {Data Type} gitolite-rc-file
Data type representing the Gitolite RC file.

@table @asis
@item @code{umask} (default: @code{#o0077})
This controls the permissions Gitolite sets on the repositories and their
contents.

A value like @code{#o0027} will give read access to the group used by Gitolite
(by default: @code{git}). This is necessary when using Gitolite with software
like cgit or gitweb.

@item @code{git-config-keys} (default: @code{""})
Gitolite allows you to set git config values using the "config" keyword. This
setting allows control over the config keys to accept.

@item @code{roles} (default: @code{'(("READERS" . 1) ("WRITERS" . ))})
Set the role names allowed to be used by users running the perms command.

@item @code{enable} (default: @code{'("help" "desc" "info" "perms" "writable" "ssh-authkeys" "git-config" "daemon" "gitweb")})
This setting controls the commands and features to enable within Gitolite.

@node Setuid Programs
@section Setuid Programs

@cindex setuid programs
Some programs need to run with ``root'' privileges, even when they are
launched by unprivileged users.  A notorious example is the
@command{passwd} program, which users can run to change their
password, and which needs to access the @file{/etc/passwd} and
@file{/etc/shadow} files---something normally restricted to root, for
obvious security reasons.  To address that, these executables are
@dfn{setuid-root}, meaning that they always run with root privileges
(@pxref{How Change Persona,,, libc, The GNU C Library Reference Manual},
for more info about the setuid mechanism.)

The store itself @emph{cannot} contain setuid programs: that would be a
security issue since any user on the system can write derivations that
populate the store (@pxref{The Store}).  Thus, a different mechanism is
used: instead of changing the setuid bit directly on files that are in
the store, we let the system administrator @emph{declare} which programs
should be setuid root.

The @code{setuid-programs} field of an @code{operating-system}
declaration contains a list of G-expressions denoting the names of
programs to be setuid-root (@pxref{Using the Configuration System}).
For instance, the @command{passwd} program, which is part of the Shadow
package, can be designated by this G-expression (@pxref{G-Expressions}):

@example
#~(string-append #$shadow "/bin/passwd")
@end example

A default set of setuid programs is defined by the
@code{%setuid-programs} variable of the @code{(gnu system)} module.

@defvr {Scheme Variable} %setuid-programs
A list of G-expressions denoting common programs that are setuid-root.

The list includes commands such as @command{passwd}, @command{ping},
@command{su}, and @command{sudo}.
@end defvr

Under the hood, the actual setuid programs are created in the
@file{/run/setuid-programs} directory at system activation time.  The
files in this directory refer to the ``real'' binaries, which are in the
store.

@node X.509 Certificates
@section X.509 Certificates

@cindex HTTPS, certificates
@cindex X.509 certificates
@cindex TLS
Web servers available over HTTPS (that is, HTTP over the transport-layer
security mechanism, TLS) send client programs an @dfn{X.509 certificate}
that the client can then use to @emph{authenticate} the server.  To do
that, clients verify that the server's certificate is signed by a
so-called @dfn{certificate authority} (CA).  But to verify the CA's
signature, clients must have first acquired the CA's certificate.

Web browsers such as GNU@tie{}IceCat include their own set of CA
certificates, such that they are able to verify CA signatures
out-of-the-box.

However, most other programs that can talk HTTPS---@command{wget},
@command{git}, @command{w3m}, etc.---need to be told where CA
certificates can be found.

@cindex @code{nss-certs}
In Guix, this is done by adding a package that provides certificates
to the @code{packages} field of the @code{operating-system} declaration
(@pxref{operating-system Reference}).  Guix includes one such package,
@code{nss-certs}, which is a set of CA certificates provided as part of
Mozilla's Network Security Services.

Note that it is @emph{not} part of @var{%base-packages}, so you need to
explicitly add it.  The @file{/etc/ssl/certs} directory, which is where
most applications and libraries look for certificates by default, points
to the certificates installed globally.

Unprivileged users, including users of Guix on a foreign distro,
can also install their own certificate package in
their profile.  A number of environment variables need to be defined so
that applications and libraries know where to find them.  Namely, the
OpenSSL library honors the @code{SSL_CERT_DIR} and @code{SSL_CERT_FILE}
variables.  Some applications add their own environment variables; for
instance, the Git version control system honors the certificate bundle
pointed to by the @code{GIT_SSL_CAINFO} environment variable.  Thus, you
would typically run something like:

@example
$ guix package -i nss-certs
$ export SSL_CERT_DIR="$HOME/.guix-profile/etc/ssl/certs"
$ export SSL_CERT_FILE="$HOME/.guix-profile/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt"
$ export GIT_SSL_CAINFO="$SSL_CERT_FILE"
@end example

As another example, R requires the @code{CURL_CA_BUNDLE} environment
variable to point to a certificate bundle, so you would have to run
something like this:

@example
$ guix package -i nss-certs
$ export CURL_CA_BUNDLE="$HOME/.guix-profile/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt"
@end example

For other applications you may want to look up the required environment
variable in the relevant documentation.


@node Name Service Switch
@section Name Service Switch

@cindex name service switch
@cindex NSS
The @code{(gnu system nss)} module provides bindings to the
configuration file of the libc @dfn{name service switch} or @dfn{NSS}
(@pxref{NSS Configuration File,,, libc, The GNU C Library Reference
Manual}).  In a nutshell, the NSS is a mechanism that allows libc to be
extended with new ``name'' lookup methods for system databases, which
includes host names, service names, user accounts, and more (@pxref{Name
Service Switch, System Databases and Name Service Switch,, libc, The GNU
C Library Reference Manual}).

The NSS configuration specifies, for each system database, which lookup
method is to be used, and how the various methods are chained
together---for instance, under which circumstances NSS should try the
next method in the list.  The NSS configuration is given in the
@code{name-service-switch} field of @code{operating-system} declarations
(@pxref{operating-system Reference, @code{name-service-switch}}).

@cindex nss-mdns
@cindex .local, host name lookup
As an example, the declaration below configures the NSS to use the
@uref{http://0pointer.de/lennart/projects/nss-mdns/, @code{nss-mdns}
back-end}, which supports host name lookups over multicast DNS (mDNS)
for host names ending in @code{.local}:

@example
(name-service-switch
   (hosts (list %files    ;first, check /etc/hosts

                ;; If the above did not succeed, try
                ;; with 'mdns_minimal'.
                (name-service
                  (name "mdns_minimal")

                  ;; 'mdns_minimal' is authoritative for
                  ;; '.local'.  When it returns "not found",
                  ;; no need to try the next methods.
                  (reaction (lookup-specification
                             (not-found => return))))

                ;; Then fall back to DNS.
                (name-service
                  (name "dns"))

                ;; Finally, try with the "full" 'mdns'.
                (name-service
                  (name "mdns")))))
@end example

Do not worry: the @code{%mdns-host-lookup-nss} variable (see below)
contains this configuration, so you will not have to type it if all you
want is to have @code{.local} host lookup working.

Note that, in this case, in addition to setting the
@code{name-service-switch} of the @code{operating-system} declaration,
you also need to use @code{avahi-service-type} (@pxref{Networking Services,
@code{avahi-service-type}}), or @var{%desktop-services}, which includes it
(@pxref{Desktop Services}).  Doing this makes @code{nss-mdns} accessible
to the name service cache daemon (@pxref{Base Services,
@code{nscd-service}}).

For convenience, the following variables provide typical NSS
configurations.

@defvr {Scheme Variable} %default-nss
This is the default name service switch configuration, a
@code{name-service-switch} object.
@end defvr

@defvr {Scheme Variable} %mdns-host-lookup-nss
This is the name service switch configuration with support for host name
lookup over multicast DNS (mDNS) for host names ending in @code{.local}.
@end defvr

The reference for name service switch configuration is given below.  It
is a direct mapping of the configuration file format of the C library , so
please refer to the C library manual for more information (@pxref{NSS
Configuration File,,, libc, The GNU C Library Reference Manual}).
Compared to the configuration file format of libc NSS, it has the advantage
not only of adding this warm parenthetic feel that we like, but also
static checks: you will know about syntax errors and typos as soon as you
run @command{guix system}.

@deftp {Data Type} name-service-switch

This is the data type representation the configuration of libc's name
service switch (NSS).  Each field below represents one of the supported
system databases.

@table @code
@item aliases
@itemx ethers
@itemx group
@itemx gshadow
@itemx hosts
@itemx initgroups
@itemx netgroup
@itemx networks
@itemx password
@itemx public-key
@itemx rpc
@itemx services
@itemx shadow
The system databases handled by the NSS.  Each of these fields must be a
list of @code{<name-service>} objects (see below).
@end table
@end deftp

@deftp {Data Type} name-service

This is the data type representing an actual name service and the
associated lookup action.

@table @code
@item name
A string denoting the name service (@pxref{Services in the NSS
configuration,,, libc, The GNU C Library Reference Manual}).

Note that name services listed here must be visible to nscd.  This is
achieved by passing the @code{#:name-services} argument to
@code{nscd-service} the list of packages providing the needed name
services (@pxref{Base Services, @code{nscd-service}}).

@item reaction
An action specified using the @code{lookup-specification} macro
(@pxref{Actions in the NSS configuration,,, libc, The GNU C Library
Reference Manual}).  For example:

@example
(lookup-specification (unavailable => continue)
                      (success => return))
@end example
@end table
@end deftp

@node Initial RAM Disk
@section Initial RAM Disk

@cindex initrd
@cindex initial RAM disk
For bootstrapping purposes, the Linux-Libre kernel is passed an
@dfn{initial RAM disk}, or @dfn{initrd}.  An initrd contains a temporary
root file system as well as an initialization script.  The latter is
responsible for mounting the real root file system, and for loading any
kernel modules that may be needed to achieve that.

The @code{initrd-modules} field of an @code{operating-system}
declaration allows you to specify Linux-libre kernel modules that must
be available in the initrd.  In particular, this is where you would list
modules needed to actually drive the hard disk where your root partition
is---although the default value of @code{initrd-modules} should cover
most use cases.  For example, assuming you need the @code{megaraid_sas}
module in addition to the default modules to be able to access your root
file system, you would write:

@example
(operating-system
  ;; @dots{}
  (initrd-modules (cons "megaraid_sas" %base-initrd-modules)))
@end example

@defvr {Scheme Variable} %base-initrd-modules
This is the list of kernel modules included in the initrd by default.
@end defvr

Furthermore, if you need lower-level customization, the @code{initrd}
field of an @code{operating-system} declaration allows
you to specify which initrd you would like to use.  The @code{(gnu
system linux-initrd)} module provides three ways to build an initrd: the
high-level @code{base-initrd} procedure and the low-level
@code{raw-initrd} and @code{expression->initrd} procedures.

The @code{base-initrd} procedure is intended to cover most common uses.
For example, if you want to add a bunch of kernel modules to be loaded
at boot time, you can define the @code{initrd} field of the operating
system declaration like this:

@example
(initrd (lambda (file-systems . rest)
          ;; Create a standard initrd but set up networking
          ;; with the parameters QEMU expects by default.
          (apply base-initrd file-systems
                 #:qemu-networking? #t
                 rest)))
@end example

The @code{base-initrd} procedure also handles common use cases that
involves using the system as a QEMU guest, or as a ``live'' system with
volatile root file system.

The @code{base-initrd} procedure is built from @code{raw-initrd} procedure.
Unlike @code{base-initrd}, @code{raw-initrd} doesn't do anything high-level,
such as trying to guess which kernel modules and packages should be included
to the initrd. An example use of @code{raw-initrd} is when a user has
a custom Linux kernel configuration and default kernel modules included by
@code{base-initrd} are not available.

The initial RAM disk produced by @code{base-initrd} or @code{raw-initrd}
honors several options passed on the Linux kernel command line
(that is, arguments passed @i{via} the @code{linux} command of GRUB, or the
@code{-append} option of QEMU), notably:

@table @code
@item --load=@var{boot}
Tell the initial RAM disk to load @var{boot}, a file containing a Scheme
program, once it has mounted the root file system.

Guix uses this option to yield control to a boot program that runs the
service activation programs and then spawns the GNU@tie{}Shepherd, the
initialization system.

@item --root=@var{root}
Mount @var{root} as the root file system.  @var{root} can be a
device name like @code{/dev/sda1}, a file system label, or a file system
UUID.

@item --system=@var{system}
Have @file{/run/booted-system} and @file{/run/current-system} point to
@var{system}.

@item modprobe.blacklist=@var{modules}@dots{}
@cindex module, black-listing
@cindex black list, of kernel modules
Instruct the initial RAM disk as well as the @command{modprobe} command
(from the kmod package) to refuse to load @var{modules}.  @var{modules}
must be a comma-separated list of module names---e.g.,
@code{usbkbd,9pnet}.

@item --repl
Start a read-eval-print loop (REPL) from the initial RAM disk before it
tries to load kernel modules and to mount the root file system.  Our
marketing team calls it @dfn{boot-to-Guile}.  The Schemer in you will
love it.  @xref{Using Guile Interactively,,, guile, GNU Guile Reference
Manual}, for more information on Guile's REPL.

@end table

Now that you know all the features that initial RAM disks produced by
@code{base-initrd} and @code{raw-initrd} provide,
here is how to use it and customize it further.

@cindex initrd
@cindex initial RAM disk
@deffn {Scheme Procedure} raw-initrd @var{file-systems} @
       [#:linux-modules '()] [#:mapped-devices '()] @
       [#:keyboard-layout #f] @
       [#:helper-packages '()] [#:qemu-networking? #f] [#:volatile-root? #f]
Return a derivation that builds a raw initrd.  @var{file-systems} is
a list of file systems to be mounted by the initrd, possibly in addition to
the root file system specified on the kernel command line via @code{--root}.
@var{linux-modules} is a list of kernel modules to be loaded at boot time.
@var{mapped-devices} is a list of device mappings to realize before
@var{file-systems} are mounted (@pxref{Mapped Devices}).
@var{helper-packages} is a list of packages to be copied in the initrd. It may
include @code{e2fsck/static} or other packages needed by the initrd to check
the root file system.

When true, @var{keyboard-layout} is a @code{<keyboard-layout>} record denoting
the desired console keyboard layout.  This is done before @var{mapped-devices}
are set up and before @var{file-systems} are mounted such that, should the
user need to enter a passphrase or use the REPL, this happens using the
intended keyboard layout.

When @var{qemu-networking?} is true, set up networking with the standard QEMU
parameters.  When @var{virtio?} is true, load additional modules so that the
initrd can be used as a QEMU guest with para-virtualized I/O drivers.

When @var{volatile-root?} is true, the root file system is writable but any changes
to it are lost.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} base-initrd @var{file-systems} @
       [#:mapped-devices '()] [#:keyboard-layout #f] @
       [#:qemu-networking? #f] [#:volatile-root? #f] @
       [#:linux-modules '()]
Return as a file-like object a generic initrd, with kernel
modules taken from @var{linux}.  @var{file-systems} is a list of file-systems to be
mounted by the initrd, possibly in addition to the root file system specified
on the kernel command line via @code{--root}.  @var{mapped-devices} is a list of device
mappings to realize before @var{file-systems} are mounted.

When true, @var{keyboard-layout} is a @code{<keyboard-layout>} record denoting
the desired console keyboard layout.  This is done before @var{mapped-devices}
are set up and before @var{file-systems} are mounted such that, should the
user need to enter a passphrase or use the REPL, this happens using the
intended keyboard layout.

@var{qemu-networking?} and @var{volatile-root?} behaves as in @code{raw-initrd}.

The initrd is automatically populated with all the kernel modules necessary
for @var{file-systems} and for the given options.  Additional kernel
modules can be listed in @var{linux-modules}.  They will be added to the initrd, and
loaded at boot time in the order in which they appear.
@end deffn

Needless to say, the initrds we produce and use embed a
statically-linked Guile, and the initialization program is a Guile
program.  That gives a lot of flexibility.  The
@code{expression->initrd} procedure builds such an initrd, given the
program to run in that initrd.

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} expression->initrd @var{exp} @
       [#:guile %guile-static-stripped] [#:name "guile-initrd"]
Return as a file-like object a Linux initrd (a gzipped cpio archive)
containing @var{guile} and that evaluates @var{exp}, a G-expression,
upon booting.  All the derivations referenced by @var{exp} are
automatically copied to the initrd.
@end deffn

@node Bootloader Configuration
@section Bootloader Configuration

@cindex bootloader
@cindex boot loader

The operating system supports multiple bootloaders.  The bootloader is
configured using @code{bootloader-configuration} declaration.  All the
fields of this structure are bootloader agnostic except for one field,
@code{bootloader} that indicates the bootloader to be configured and
installed.

Some of the bootloaders do not honor every field of
@code{bootloader-configuration}.  For instance, the extlinux
bootloader does not support themes and thus ignores the @code{theme}
field.

@deftp {Data Type} bootloader-configuration
The type of a bootloader configuration declaration.

@table @asis

@item @code{bootloader}
@cindex EFI, bootloader
@cindex UEFI, bootloader
@cindex BIOS, bootloader
The bootloader to use, as a @code{bootloader} object. For now
@code{grub-bootloader}, @code{grub-efi-bootloader},
@code{extlinux-bootloader} and @code{u-boot-bootloader} are supported.

@vindex grub-efi-bootloader
@code{grub-efi-bootloader} allows to boot on modern systems using the
@dfn{Unified Extensible Firmware Interface} (UEFI).  This is what you should
use if the installation image contains a @file{/sys/firmware/efi} directory
when you boot it on your system.

@vindex grub-bootloader
@code{grub-bootloader} allows you to boot in particular Intel-based machines
in ``legacy'' BIOS mode.

@cindex ARM, bootloaders
@cindex AArch64, bootloaders
Available bootloaders are described in @code{(gnu bootloader @dots{})}
modules.  In particular, @code{(gnu bootloader u-boot)} contains definitions
of bootloaders for a wide range of ARM and AArch64 systems, using the
@uref{http://www.denx.de/wiki/U-Boot/, U-Boot bootloader}.

@item @code{target}
This is a string denoting the target onto which to install the
bootloader.

The interpretation depends on the bootloader in question.  For
@code{grub-bootloader}, for example, it should be a device name understood by
the bootloader @command{installer} command, such as @code{/dev/sda} or
@code{(hd0)} (@pxref{Invoking grub-install,,, grub, GNU GRUB Manual}).  For
@code{grub-efi-bootloader}, it should be the mount point of the EFI file
system, usually @file{/boot/efi}.

@item @code{menu-entries} (default: @code{()})
A possibly empty list of @code{menu-entry} objects (see below), denoting
entries to appear in the bootloader menu, in addition to the current
system entry and the entry pointing to previous system generations.

@item @code{default-entry} (default: @code{0})
The index of the default boot menu entry.  Index 0 is for the entry of the
current system.

@item @code{timeout} (default: @code{5})
The number of seconds to wait for keyboard input before booting.  Set to
0 to boot immediately, and to -1 to wait indefinitely.

@cindex keyboard layout, for the bootloader
@item @code{keyboard-layout} (default: @code{#f})
If this is @code{#f}, the bootloader's menu (if any) uses the default keyboard
layout, usually US@tie{}English (``qwerty'').

Otherwise, this must be a @code{keyboard-layout} object (@pxref{Keyboard
Layout}).

@quotation Note
This option is currently ignored by bootloaders other than @code{grub} and
@code{grub-efi}.
@end quotation

@item @code{theme} (default: @var{#f})
The bootloader theme object describing the theme to use.  If no theme
is provided, some bootloaders might use a default theme, that's true
for GRUB.

@item @code{terminal-outputs} (default: @code{'gfxterm})
The output terminals used for the bootloader boot menu, as a list of
symbols.  GRUB accepts the values: @code{console}, @code{serial},
@code{serial_@{0-3@}}, @code{gfxterm}, @code{vga_text},
@code{mda_text}, @code{morse}, and @code{pkmodem}.  This field
corresponds to the GRUB variable @code{GRUB_TERMINAL_OUTPUT} (@pxref{Simple
configuration,,, grub,GNU GRUB manual}).

@item @code{terminal-inputs} (default: @code{'()})
The input terminals used for the bootloader boot menu, as a list of
symbols.  For GRUB, the default is the native platform terminal as
determined at run-time.  GRUB accepts the values: @code{console},
@code{serial}, @code{serial_@{0-3@}}, @code{at_keyboard}, and
@code{usb_keyboard}.  This field corresponds to the GRUB variable
@code{GRUB_TERMINAL_INPUT} (@pxref{Simple configuration,,, grub,GNU GRUB
manual}).

@item @code{serial-unit} (default: @code{#f})
The serial unit used by the bootloader, as an integer from 0 to 3.
For GRUB, it is chosen at run-time; currently GRUB chooses 0, which
corresponds to COM1 (@pxref{Serial terminal,,, grub,GNU GRUB manual}).

@item @code{serial-speed} (default: @code{#f})
The speed of the serial interface, as an integer.  For GRUB, the
default value is chosen at run-time; currently GRUB chooses
9600@tie{}bps (@pxref{Serial terminal,,, grub,GNU GRUB manual}).
@end table

@end deftp

@cindex dual boot
@cindex boot menu
Should you want to list additional boot menu entries @i{via} the
@code{menu-entries} field above, you will need to create them with the
@code{menu-entry} form.  For example, imagine you want to be able to
boot another distro (hard to imagine!), you can define a menu entry
along these lines:

@example
(menu-entry
  (label "The Other Distro")
  (linux "/boot/old/vmlinux-2.6.32")
  (linux-arguments '("root=/dev/sda2"))
  (initrd "/boot/old/initrd"))
@end example

Details below.

@deftp {Data Type} menu-entry
The type of an entry in the bootloader menu.

@table @asis

@item @code{label}
The label to show in the menu---e.g., @code{"GNU"}.

@item @code{linux}
The Linux kernel image to boot, for example:

@example
(file-append linux-libre "/bzImage")
@end example

For GRUB, it is also possible to specify a device explicitly in the
file path using GRUB's device naming convention (@pxref{Naming
convention,,, grub, GNU GRUB manual}), for example:

@example
"(hd0,msdos1)/boot/vmlinuz"
@end example

If the device is specified explicitly as above, then the @code{device}
field is ignored entirely.

@item @code{linux-arguments} (default: @code{()})
The list of extra Linux kernel command-line arguments---e.g.,
@code{("console=ttyS0")}.

@item @code{initrd}
A G-Expression or string denoting the file name of the initial RAM disk
to use (@pxref{G-Expressions}).
@item @code{device} (default: @code{#f})
The device where the kernel and initrd are to be found---i.e., for GRUB,
@dfn{root} for this menu entry (@pxref{root,,, grub, GNU GRUB manual}).

This may be a file system label (a string), a file system UUID (a
bytevector, @pxref{File Systems}), or @code{#f}, in which case
the bootloader will search the device containing the file specified by
the @code{linux} field (@pxref{search,,, grub, GNU GRUB manual}).  It
must @emph{not} be an OS device name such as @file{/dev/sda1}.

@end table
@end deftp

@c FIXME: Write documentation once it's stable.
For now only GRUB has theme support. GRUB themes are created using
the @code{grub-theme} form, which is not documented yet.

@defvr {Scheme Variable} %default-theme
This is the default GRUB theme used by the operating system if no
@code{theme} field is specified in @code{bootloader-configuration}
record.

It comes with a fancy background image displaying the GNU and Guix
logos.
@end defvr


@node Invoking guix system
@section Invoking @code{guix system}

Once you have written an operating system declaration as seen in the
previous section, it can be @dfn{instantiated} using the @command{guix
system} command.  The synopsis is:

@example
guix system @var{options}@dots{} @var{action} @var{file}
@end example

@var{file} must be the name of a file containing an
@code{operating-system} declaration.  @var{action} specifies how the
operating system is instantiated.  Currently the following values are
supported:

@table @code
@item search
Display available service type definitions that match the given regular
expressions, sorted by relevance:

@example
$ guix system search console font
name: console-fonts
location: gnu/services/base.scm:729:2
extends: shepherd-root
description: Install the given fonts on the specified ttys (fonts are
+ per virtual console on GNU/Linux).  The value of this service is a list
+ of tty/font pairs like:
+ 
+      '(("tty1" . "LatGrkCyr-8x16"))
relevance: 20

name: mingetty
location: gnu/services/base.scm:1048:2
extends: shepherd-root
description: Provide console login using the `mingetty' program.
relevance: 2

name: login
location: gnu/services/base.scm:775:2
extends: pam
description: Provide a console log-in service as specified by its
+ configuration value, a `login-configuration' object.
relevance: 2

@dots{}
@end example

As for @command{guix package --search}, the result is written in
@code{recutils} format, which makes it easy to filter the output
(@pxref{Top, GNU recutils databases,, recutils, GNU recutils manual}).

@item reconfigure
Build the operating system described in @var{file}, activate it, and
switch to it@footnote{This action (and the related actions
@code{switch-generation} and @code{roll-back}) are usable only on
systems already running Guix System.}.

This effects all the configuration specified in @var{file}: user
accounts, system services, global package list, setuid programs, etc.
The command starts system services specified in @var{file} that are not
currently running; if a service is currently running this command will
arrange for it to be upgraded the next time it is stopped (e.g.@: by
@code{herd stop X} or @code{herd restart X}).

This command creates a new generation whose number is one greater than
the current generation (as reported by @command{guix system
list-generations}).  If that generation already exists, it will be
overwritten.  This behavior mirrors that of @command{guix package}
(@pxref{Invoking guix package}).

It also adds a bootloader menu entry for the new OS configuration,
---unless @option{--no-bootloader} is passed.  For GRUB, it moves
entries for older configurations to a submenu, allowing you to choose
an older system generation at boot time should you need it.

@quotation Note
@c The paragraph below refers to the problem discussed at
@c <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/guix-devel/2014-08/msg00057.html>.
It is highly recommended to run @command{guix pull} once before you run
@command{guix system reconfigure} for the first time (@pxref{Invoking
guix pull}).  Failing to do that you would see an older version of Guix
once @command{reconfigure} has completed.
@end quotation

@item switch-generation
@cindex generations
Switch to an existing system generation.  This action atomically
switches the system profile to the specified system generation.  It
also rearranges the system's existing bootloader menu entries.  It
makes the menu entry for the specified system generation the default,
and it moves the entries for the other generatiors to a submenu, if
supported by the bootloader being used.  The next time the system
boots, it will use the specified system generation.

The bootloader itself is not being reinstalled when using this
command.  Thus, the installed bootloader is used with an updated
configuration file.

The target generation can be specified explicitly by its generation
number.  For example, the following invocation would switch to system
generation 7:

@example
guix system switch-generation 7
@end example

The target generation can also be specified relative to the current
generation with the form @code{+N} or @code{-N}, where @code{+3} means
``3 generations ahead of the current generation,'' and @code{-1} means
``1 generation prior to the current generation.''  When specifying a
negative value such as @code{-1}, you must precede it with @code{--} to
prevent it from being parsed as an option.  For example:

@example
guix system switch-generation -- -1
@end example

Currently, the effect of invoking this action is @emph{only} to switch
the system profile to an existing generation and rearrange the
bootloader menu entries.  To actually start using the target system
generation, you must reboot after running this action.  In the future,
it will be updated to do the same things as @command{reconfigure},
like activating and deactivating services.

This action will fail if the specified generation does not exist.

@item roll-back
@cindex rolling back
Switch to the preceding system generation.  The next time the system
boots, it will use the preceding system generation.  This is the inverse
of @command{reconfigure}, and it is exactly the same as invoking
@command{switch-generation} with an argument of @code{-1}.

Currently, as with @command{switch-generation}, you must reboot after
running this action to actually start using the preceding system
generation.

@item delete-generations
@cindex deleting system generations
@cindex saving space
Delete system generations, making them candidates for garbage collection
(@pxref{Invoking guix gc}, for information on how to run the ``garbage
collector'').

This works in the same way as @command{guix package --delete-generations}
(@pxref{Invoking guix package, @code{--delete-generations}}).  With no
arguments, all system generations but the current one are deleted:

@example
guix system delete-generations
@end example

You can also select the generations you want to delete.  The example below
deletes all the system generations that are more than two month old:

@example
guix system delete-generations 2m
@end example

Running this command automatically reinstalls the bootloader with an updated
list of menu entries---e.g., the ``old generations'' sub-menu in GRUB no
longer lists the generations that have been deleted.

@item build
Build the derivation of the operating system, which includes all the
configuration files and programs needed to boot and run the system.
This action does not actually install anything.

@item init
Populate the given directory with all the files necessary to run the
operating system specified in @var{file}.  This is useful for first-time
installations of Guix System.  For instance:

@example
guix system init my-os-config.scm /mnt
@end example

copies to @file{/mnt} all the store items required by the configuration
specified in @file{my-os-config.scm}.  This includes configuration
files, packages, and so on.  It also creates other essential files
needed for the system to operate correctly---e.g., the @file{/etc},
@file{/var}, and @file{/run} directories, and the @file{/bin/sh} file.

This command also installs bootloader on the target specified in
@file{my-os-config}, unless the @option{--no-bootloader} option was
passed.

@item vm
@cindex virtual machine
@cindex VM
@anchor{guix system vm}
Build a virtual machine that contains the operating system declared in
@var{file}, and return a script to run that virtual machine (VM).

@quotation Note
The @code{vm} action and others below
can use KVM support in the Linux-libre kernel.  Specifically, if the
machine has hardware virtualization support, the corresponding
KVM kernel module should be loaded, and the @file{/dev/kvm} device node
must exist and be readable and writable by the user and by the
build users of the daemon (@pxref{Build Environment Setup}).
@end quotation

Arguments given to the script are passed to QEMU as in the example
below, which enables networking and requests 1@tie{}GiB of RAM for the
emulated machine:

@example
$ /gnu/store/@dots{}-run-vm.sh -m 1024 -net user
@end example

The VM shares its store with the host system.

Additional file systems can be shared between the host and the VM using
the @code{--share} and @code{--expose} command-line options: the former
specifies a directory to be shared with write access, while the latter
provides read-only access to the shared directory.

The example below creates a VM in which the user's home directory is
accessible read-only, and where the @file{/exchange} directory is a
read-write mapping of @file{$HOME/tmp} on the host:

@example
guix system vm my-config.scm \
   --expose=$HOME --share=$HOME/tmp=/exchange
@end example

On GNU/Linux, the default is to boot directly to the kernel; this has
the advantage of requiring only a very tiny root disk image since the
store of the host can then be mounted.

The @code{--full-boot} option forces a complete boot sequence, starting
with the bootloader.  This requires more disk space since a root image
containing at least the kernel, initrd, and bootloader data files must
be created.  The @code{--image-size} option can be used to specify the
size of the image.

@cindex System images, creation in various formats
@cindex Creating system images in various formats
@item vm-image
@itemx disk-image
@itemx docker-image
Return a virtual machine, disk image, or Docker image of the operating
system declared in @var{file} that stands alone.  By default,
@command{guix system} estimates the size of the image needed to store
the system, but you can use the @option{--image-size} option to specify
a value.  Docker images are built to contain exactly what they need, so
the @option{--image-size} option is ignored in the case of
@code{docker-image}.

You can specify the root file system type by using the
@option{--file-system-type} option.  It defaults to @code{ext4}.

When using @code{vm-image}, the returned image is in qcow2 format, which
the QEMU emulator can efficiently use. @xref{Running Guix in a VM},
for more information on how to run the image in a virtual machine.

When using @code{disk-image}, a raw disk image is produced; it can be
copied as is to a USB stick, for instance.  Assuming @code{/dev/sdc} is
the device corresponding to a USB stick, one can copy the image to it
using the following command:

@example
# dd if=$(guix system disk-image my-os.scm) of=/dev/sdc
@end example

When using @code{docker-image}, a Docker image is produced.  Guix builds
the image from scratch, not from a pre-existing Docker base image.  As a
result, it contains @emph{exactly} what you define in the operating
system configuration file.  You can then load the image and launch a
Docker container using commands like the following:

@example
image_id="$(docker load < guix-system-docker-image.tar.gz)"
docker run -e GUIX_NEW_SYSTEM=/var/guix/profiles/system \\
    --entrypoint /var/guix/profiles/system/profile/bin/guile \\
    $image_id /var/guix/profiles/system/boot
@end example

This command starts a new Docker container from the specified image.  It
will boot the Guix system in the usual manner, which means it will
start any services you have defined in the operating system
configuration.  Depending on what you run in the Docker container, it
may be necessary to give the container additional permissions.  For
example, if you intend to build software using Guix inside of the Docker
container, you may need to pass the @option{--privileged} option to
@code{docker run}.

@item container
Return a script to run the operating system declared in @var{file}
within a container.  Containers are a set of lightweight isolation
mechanisms provided by the kernel Linux-libre.  Containers are
substantially less resource-demanding than full virtual machines since
the kernel, shared objects, and other resources can be shared with the
host system; this also means they provide thinner isolation.

Currently, the script must be run as root in order to support more than
a single user and group.  The container shares its store with the host
system.

As with the @code{vm} action (@pxref{guix system vm}), additional file
systems to be shared between the host and container can be specified
using the @option{--share} and @option{--expose} options:

@example
guix system container my-config.scm \
   --expose=$HOME --share=$HOME/tmp=/exchange
@end example

@quotation Note
This option requires Linux-libre 3.19 or newer.
@end quotation

@end table

@var{options} can contain any of the common build options (@pxref{Common
Build Options}).  In addition, @var{options} can contain one of the
following:

@table @option
@item --expression=@var{expr}
@itemx -e @var{expr}
Consider the operating-system @var{expr} evaluates to.
This is an alternative to specifying a file which evaluates to an
operating system.
This is used to generate the Guix system installer @pxref{Building the
Installation Image}).

@item --system=@var{system}
@itemx -s @var{system}
Attempt to build for @var{system} instead of the host system type.
This works as per @command{guix build} (@pxref{Invoking guix build}).

@item --derivation
@itemx -d
Return the derivation file name of the given operating system without
building anything.

@item --file-system-type=@var{type}
@itemx -t @var{type}
For the @code{disk-image} action, create a file system of the given
@var{type} on the image.

When this option is omitted, @command{guix system} uses @code{ext4}.

@cindex ISO-9660 format
@cindex CD image format
@cindex DVD image format
@code{--file-system-type=iso9660} produces an ISO-9660 image, suitable
for burning on CDs and DVDs.

@item --image-size=@var{size}
For the @code{vm-image} and @code{disk-image} actions, create an image
of the given @var{size}.  @var{size} may be a number of bytes, or it may
include a unit as a suffix (@pxref{Block size, size specifications,,
coreutils, GNU Coreutils}).

When this option is omitted, @command{guix system} computes an estimate
of the image size as a function of the size of the system declared in
@var{file}.

@item --root=@var{file}
@itemx -r @var{file}
Make @var{file} a symlink to the result, and register it as a garbage
collector root.

@item --skip-checks
Skip pre-installation safety checks.

By default, @command{guix system init} and @command{guix system
reconfigure} perform safety checks: they make sure the file systems that
appear in the @code{operating-system} declaration actually exist
(@pxref{File Systems}), and that any Linux kernel modules that may be
needed at boot time are listed in @code{initrd-modules} (@pxref{Initial
RAM Disk}).  Passing this option skips these tests altogether.

@cindex on-error
@cindex on-error strategy
@cindex error strategy
@item --on-error=@var{strategy}
Apply @var{strategy} when an error occurs when reading @var{file}.
@var{strategy} may be one of the following:

@table @code
@item nothing-special
Report the error concisely and exit.  This is the default strategy.

@item backtrace
Likewise, but also display a backtrace.

@item debug
Report the error and enter Guile's debugger.  From there, you can run
commands such as @code{,bt} to get a backtrace, @code{,locals} to
display local variable values, and more generally inspect the state of the
program.  @xref{Debug Commands,,, guile, GNU Guile Reference Manual}, for
a list of available debugging commands.
@end table
@end table

Once you have built, configured, re-configured, and re-re-configured
your Guix installation, you may find it useful to list the operating
system generations available on disk---and that you can choose from the
bootloader boot menu:

@table @code

@item list-generations
List a summary of each generation of the operating system available on
disk, in a human-readable way.  This is similar to the
@option{--list-generations} option of @command{guix package}
(@pxref{Invoking guix package}).

Optionally, one can specify a pattern, with the same syntax that is used
in @command{guix package --list-generations}, to restrict the list of
generations displayed.  For instance, the following command displays
generations that are up to 10 days old:

@example
$ guix system list-generations 10d
@end example

@end table

The @command{guix system} command has even more to offer!  The following
sub-commands allow you to visualize how your system services relate to
each other:

@anchor{system-extension-graph}
@table @code

@item extension-graph
Emit in Dot/Graphviz format to standard output the @dfn{service
extension graph} of the operating system defined in @var{file}
(@pxref{Service Composition}, for more information on service
extensions.)

The command:

@example
$ guix system extension-graph @var{file} | dot -Tpdf > services.pdf
@end example

produces a PDF file showing the extension relations among services.

@anchor{system-shepherd-graph}
@item shepherd-graph
Emit in Dot/Graphviz format to standard output the @dfn{dependency
graph} of shepherd services of the operating system defined in
@var{file}.  @xref{Shepherd Services}, for more information and for an
example graph.

@end table

@node Running Guix in a VM
@section Running Guix in a Virtual Machine

@cindex virtual machine
To run Guix in a virtual machine (VM), one can either use the
pre-built Guix VM image distributed at
@indicateurl{https://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/guix/guix-system-vm-image-@value{VERSION}.@var{system}.xz}
, or build their own virtual machine image using @command{guix system
vm-image} (@pxref{Invoking guix system}).  The returned image is in
qcow2 format, which the @uref{http://qemu.org/, QEMU emulator} can
efficiently use.

@cindex QEMU
If you built your own image, you must copy it out of the store
(@pxref{The Store}) and give yourself permission to write to the copy
before you can use it.  When invoking QEMU, you must choose a system
emulator that is suitable for your hardware platform.  Here is a minimal
QEMU invocation that will boot the result of @command{guix system
vm-image} on x86_64 hardware:

@example
$ qemu-system-x86_64 \
   -net user -net nic,model=virtio \
   -enable-kvm -m 256 /tmp/qemu-image
@end example

Here is what each of these options means:

@table @code
@item qemu-system-x86_64
This specifies the hardware platform to emulate.  This should match the
host.

@item -net user
Enable the unprivileged user-mode network stack.  The guest OS can
access the host but not vice versa.  This is the simplest way to get the
guest OS online.

@item -net nic,model=virtio
You must create a network interface of a given model.  If you do not
create a NIC, the boot will fail.  Assuming your hardware platform is
x86_64, you can get a list of available NIC models by running
@command{qemu-system-x86_64 -net nic,model=help}.

@item -enable-kvm
If your system has hardware virtualization extensions, enabling the
virtual machine support (KVM) of the Linux kernel will make things run
faster.

@item -m 256
RAM available to the guest OS, in mebibytes.  Defaults to 128@tie{}MiB,
which may be insufficient for some operations.

@item /tmp/qemu-image
The file name of the qcow2 image.
@end table

The default @command{run-vm.sh} script that is returned by an invocation of
@command{guix system vm} does not add a @command{-net user} flag by default.
To get network access from within the vm add the @code{(dhcp-client-service)}
to your system definition and start the VM using
@command{`guix system vm config.scm` -net user}.  An important caveat of using
@command{-net user} for networking is that @command{ping} will not work, because
it uses the ICMP protocol.  You'll have to use a different command to check for
network connectivity, for example @command{guix download}.

@subsection Connecting Through SSH

@cindex SSH
@cindex SSH server
To enable SSH inside a VM you need to add a SSH server like @code{(dropbear-service)}
or @code{(lsh-service)} to your VM.  The @code{(lsh-service}) doesn't currently
boot unsupervised.  It requires you to type some characters to initialize the
randomness generator.  In addition you need to forward the SSH port, 22 by
default, to the host.  You can do this with

@example
`guix system vm config.scm` -net user,hostfwd=tcp::10022-:22
@end example

To connect to the VM you can run

@example
ssh -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -p 10022
@end example

The @command{-p} tells @command{ssh} the port you want to connect to.
@command{-o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null} prevents @command{ssh} from complaining
every time you modify your @command{config.scm} file and the
@command{-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no} prevents you from having to allow a
connection to an unknown host every time you connect.

@subsection Using @command{virt-viewer} with Spice

As an alternative to the default @command{qemu} graphical client you can
use the @command{remote-viewer} from the @command{virt-viewer} package.  To
connect pass the @command{-spice port=5930,disable-ticketing} flag to
@command{qemu}.  See previous section for further information on how to do this.

Spice also allows you to do some nice stuff like share your clipboard with your
VM.  To enable that you'll also have to pass the following flags to @command{qemu}:

@example
-device virtio-serial-pci,id=virtio-serial0,max_ports=16,bus=pci.0,addr=0x5
-chardev spicevmc,name=vdagent,id=vdagent
-device virtserialport,nr=1,bus=virtio-serial0.0,chardev=vdagent,
name=com.redhat.spice.0
@end example

You'll also need to add the @pxref{Miscellaneous Services, Spice service}.

@node Defining Services
@section Defining Services

The previous sections show the available services and how one can combine
them in an @code{operating-system} declaration.  But how do we define
them in the first place?  And what is a service anyway?

@menu

@end menu

@node Service Composition
@subsection Service Composition

@cindex services
@cindex daemons
Here we define a @dfn{service} as, broadly, something that extends the
functionality of the operating system.  Often a service is a process---a
@dfn{daemon}---started when the system boots: a secure shell server, a
Web server, the Guix build daemon, etc.  Sometimes a service is a daemon
whose execution can be triggered by another daemon---e.g., an FTP server
started by @command{inetd} or a D-Bus service activated by
@command{dbus-daemon}.  Occasionally, a service does not map to a
daemon.  For instance, the ``account'' service collects user accounts
and makes sure they exist when the system runs; the ``udev'' service
collects device management rules and makes them available to the eudev
daemon; the @file{/etc} service populates the @file{/etc} directory
of the system.

@cindex service extensions
Guix system services are connected by @dfn{extensions}.  For instance, the
secure shell service @emph{extends} the Shepherd---the
initialization system, running as PID@tie{}1---by giving it the command
lines to start and stop the secure shell daemon (@pxref{Networking
Services, @code{openssh-service-type}}); the UPower service extends the D-Bus
service by passing it its @file{.service} specification, and extends the
udev service by passing it device management rules (@pxref{Desktop
Services, @code{upower-service}}); the Guix daemon service extends the
Shepherd by passing it the command lines to start and stop the daemon,
and extends the account service by passing it a list of required build
user accounts (@pxref{Base Services}).

All in all, services and their ``extends'' relations form a directed
acyclic graph (DAG).  If we represent services as boxes and extensions
as arrows, a typical system might provide something like this:

@image{images/service-graph,,5in,Typical service extension graph.}

@cindex system service
At the bottom, we see the @dfn{system service}, which produces the
directory containing everything to run and boot the system, as returned
by the @command{guix system build} command.  @xref{Service Reference},
to learn about the other service types shown here.
@xref{system-extension-graph, the @command{guix system extension-graph}
command}, for information on how to generate this representation for a
particular operating system definition.

@cindex service types
Technically, developers can define @dfn{service types} to express these
relations.  There can be any number of services of a given type on the
system---for instance, a system running two instances of the GNU secure
shell server (lsh) has two instances of @code{lsh-service-type}, with
different parameters.

The following section describes the programming interface for service
types and services.

@node Service Types and Services
@subsection Service Types and Services

A @dfn{service type} is a node in the DAG described above.  Let us start
with a simple example, the service type for the Guix build daemon
(@pxref{Invoking guix-daemon}):

@example
(define guix-service-type
  (service-type
   (name 'guix)
   (extensions
    (list (service-extension shepherd-root-service-type guix-shepherd-service)
          (service-extension account-service-type guix-accounts)
          (service-extension activation-service-type guix-activation)))
   (default-value (guix-configuration))))
@end example

@noindent
It defines three things:

@enumerate
@item
A name, whose sole purpose is to make inspection and debugging easier.

@item
A list of @dfn{service extensions}, where each extension designates the
target service type and a procedure that, given the parameters of the
service, returns a list of objects to extend the service of that type.

Every service type has at least one service extension.  The only
exception is the @dfn{boot service type}, which is the ultimate service.

@item
Optionally, a default value for instances of this type.
@end enumerate

In this example, @var{guix-service-type} extends three services:

@table @var
@item shepherd-root-service-type
The @var{guix-shepherd-service} procedure defines how the Shepherd
service is extended.  Namely, it returns a @code{<shepherd-service>}
object that defines how @command{guix-daemon} is started and stopped
(@pxref{Shepherd Services}).

@item account-service-type
This extension for this service is computed by @var{guix-accounts},
which returns a list of @code{user-group} and @code{user-account}
objects representing the build user accounts (@pxref{Invoking
guix-daemon}).

@item activation-service-type
Here @var{guix-activation} is a procedure that returns a gexp, which is
a code snippet to run at ``activation time''---e.g., when the service is
booted.
@end table

A service of this type is instantiated like this:

@example
(service guix-service-type
         (guix-configuration
           (build-accounts 5)
           (use-substitutes? #f)))
@end example

The second argument to the @code{service} form is a value representing
the parameters of this specific service instance.
@xref{guix-configuration-type, @code{guix-configuration}}, for
information about the @code{guix-configuration} data type.  When the
value is omitted, the default value specified by
@code{guix-service-type} is used:

@example
(service guix-service-type)
@end example

@var{guix-service-type} is quite simple because it extends other
services but is not extensible itself.

@c @subsubsubsection Extensible Service Types

The service type for an @emph{extensible} service looks like this:

@example
(define udev-service-type
  (service-type (name 'udev)
                (extensions
                 (list (service-extension shepherd-root-service-type
                                          udev-shepherd-service)))

                (compose concatenate)       ;concatenate the list of rules
                (extend (lambda (config rules)
                          (match config
                            (($ <udev-configuration> udev initial-rules)
                             (udev-configuration
                              (udev udev)   ;the udev package to use
                              (rules (append initial-rules rules)))))))))
@end example

This is the service type for the
@uref{https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Eudev, eudev device
management daemon}.  Compared to the previous example, in addition to an
extension of @var{shepherd-root-service-type}, we see two new fields:

@table @code
@item compose
This is the procedure to @dfn{compose} the list of extensions to
services of this type.

Services can extend the udev service by passing it lists of rules; we
compose those extensions simply by concatenating them.

@item extend
This procedure defines how the value of the service is @dfn{extended} with
the composition of the extensions.

Udev extensions are composed into a list of rules, but the udev service
value is itself a @code{<udev-configuration>} record.  So here, we
extend that record by appending the list of rules it contains to the
list of contributed rules.

@item description
This is a string giving an overview of the service type.  The string can
contain Texinfo markup (@pxref{Overview,,, texinfo, GNU Texinfo}).  The
@command{guix system search} command searches these strings and displays
them (@pxref{Invoking guix system}).
@end table

There can be only one instance of an extensible service type such as
@var{udev-service-type}.  If there were more, the
@code{service-extension} specifications would be ambiguous.

Still here?  The next section provides a reference of the programming
interface for services.

@node Service Reference
@subsection Service Reference

We have seen an overview of service types (@pxref{Service Types and
Services}).  This section provides a reference on how to manipulate
services and service types.  This interface is provided by the
@code{(gnu services)} module.

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} service @var{type} [@var{value}]
Return a new service of @var{type}, a @code{<service-type>} object (see
below.)  @var{value} can be any object; it represents the parameters of
this particular service instance.

When @var{value} is omitted, the default value specified by @var{type}
is used; if @var{type} does not specify a default value, an error is
raised.

For instance, this:

@example
(service openssh-service-type)
@end example

@noindent
is equivalent to this:

@example
(service openssh-service-type
         (openssh-configuration))
@end example

In both cases the result is an instance of @code{openssh-service-type}
with the default configuration.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} service? @var{obj}
Return true if @var{obj} is a service.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} service-kind @var{service}
Return the type of @var{service}---i.e., a @code{<service-type>} object.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} service-value @var{service}
Return the value associated with @var{service}.  It represents its
parameters.
@end deffn

Here is an example of how a service is created and manipulated:

@example
(define s
  (service nginx-service-type
           (nginx-configuration
            (nginx nginx)
            (log-directory log-directory)
            (run-directory run-directory)
            (file config-file))))

(service? s)
@result{} #t

(eq? (service-kind s) nginx-service-type)
@result{} #t
@end example

The @code{modify-services} form provides a handy way to change the
parameters of some of the services of a list such as
@var{%base-services} (@pxref{Base Services, @code{%base-services}}).  It
evaluates to a list of services.  Of course, you could always use
standard list combinators such as @code{map} and @code{fold} to do that
(@pxref{SRFI-1, List Library,, guile, GNU Guile Reference Manual});
@code{modify-services} simply provides a more concise form for this
common pattern.

@deffn {Scheme Syntax} modify-services @var{services} @
  (@var{type} @var{variable} => @var{body}) @dots{}

Modify the services listed in @var{services} according to the given
clauses.  Each clause has the form:

@example
(@var{type} @var{variable} => @var{body})
@end example

where @var{type} is a service type---e.g.,
@code{guix-service-type}---and @var{variable} is an identifier that is
bound within the @var{body} to the service parameters---e.g., a
@code{guix-configuration} instance---of the original service of that
@var{type}.

The @var{body} should evaluate to the new service parameters, which will
be used to configure the new service.  This new service will replace the
original in the resulting list.  Because a service's service parameters
are created using @code{define-record-type*}, you can write a succinct
@var{body} that evaluates to the new service parameters by using the
@code{inherit} feature that @code{define-record-type*} provides.

@xref{Using the Configuration System}, for example usage.

@end deffn

Next comes the programming interface for service types.  This is
something you want to know when writing new service definitions, but not
necessarily when simply looking for ways to customize your
@code{operating-system} declaration.

@deftp {Data Type} service-type
@cindex service type
This is the representation of a @dfn{service type} (@pxref{Service Types
and Services}).

@table @asis
@item @code{name}
This is a symbol, used only to simplify inspection and debugging.

@item @code{extensions}
A non-empty list of @code{<service-extension>} objects (see below).

@item @code{compose} (default: @code{#f})
If this is @code{#f}, then the service type denotes services that cannot
be extended---i.e., services that do not receive ``values'' from other
services.

Otherwise, it must be a one-argument procedure.  The procedure is called
by @code{fold-services} and is passed a list of values collected from
extensions.  It may return any single value.

@item @code{extend} (default: @code{#f})
If this is @code{#f}, services of this type cannot be extended.

Otherwise, it must be a two-argument procedure: @code{fold-services}
calls it, passing it the initial value of the service as the first
argument and the result of applying @code{compose} to the extension
values as the second argument.  It must return a value that is a valid
parameter value for the service instance.
@end table

@xref{Service Types and Services}, for examples.
@end deftp

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} service-extension @var{target-type} @
                              @var{compute}
Return a new extension for services of type @var{target-type}.
@var{compute} must be a one-argument procedure: @code{fold-services}
calls it, passing it the value associated with the service that provides
the extension; it must return a valid value for the target service.
@end deffn

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} service-extension? @var{obj}
Return true if @var{obj} is a service extension.
@end deffn

Occasionally, you might want to simply extend an existing service.  This
involves creating a new service type and specifying the extension of
interest, which can be verbose; the @code{simple-service} procedure
provides a shorthand for this.

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} simple-service @var{name} @var{target} @var{value}
Return a service that extends @var{target} with @var{value}.  This works
by creating a singleton service type @var{name}, of which the returned
service is an instance.

For example, this extends mcron (@pxref{Scheduled Job Execution}) with
an additional job:

@example
(simple-service 'my-mcron-job mcron-service-type
                #~(job '(next-hour (3)) "guix gc -F 2G"))
@end example
@end deffn

At the core of the service abstraction lies the @code{fold-services}
procedure, which is responsible for ``compiling'' a list of services
down to a single directory that contains everything needed to boot and
run the system---the directory shown by the @command{guix system build}
command (@pxref{Invoking guix system}).  In essence, it propagates
service extensions down the service graph, updating each node parameters
on the way, until it reaches the root node.

@deffn {Scheme Procedure} fold-services @var{services} @
                            [#:target-type @var{system-service-type}]
Fold @var{services} by propagating their extensions down to the root of
type @var{target-type}; return the root service adjusted accordingly.
@end deffn

Lastly, the @code{(gnu services)} module also defines several essential
service types, some of which are listed below.

@defvr {Scheme Variable} system-service-type
This is the root of the service graph.  It produces the system directory
as returned by the @command{guix system build} command.
@end defvr

@defvr {Scheme Variable} boot-service-type
The type of the ``boot service'', which produces the @dfn{boot script}.
The boot script is what the initial RAM disk runs when booting.
@end defvr

@defvr {Scheme Variable} etc-service-type
The type of the @file{/etc} service.  This service is used to create
files under @file{/etc} and can be extended by
passing it name/file tuples such as:

@example
(list `("issue" ,(plain-file "issue" "Welcome!\n")))
@end example

In this example, the effect would be to add an @file{/etc/issue} file
pointing to the given file.
@end defvr

@defvr {Scheme Variable} setuid-program-service-type
Type for the ``setuid-program service''.  This service collects lists of
executable file names, passed as gexps, and adds them to the set of
setuid-root programs on the system (@pxref{Setuid Programs}).
@end defvr

@defvr {Scheme Variable} profile-service-type
Type of the service that populates the @dfn{system profile}---i.e., the
programs under @file{/run/current-system/profile}.  Other services can
extend it by passing it lists of packages to add to the system profile.
@end defvr


@node Shepherd Services
@subsection Shepherd Services

@cindex shepherd services
@cindex PID 1
@cindex init system
The @code{(gnu services shepherd)} module provides a way to define
services managed by the GNU@tie{}Shepherd, which is the
initialization system---the first process that is started when the
system boots, also known as PID@tie{}1
(@pxref{Introduction,,, shepherd, The GNU Shepherd Manual}).

Services in the Shepherd can depend on each other.  For instance, the
SSH daemon may need to be started after the syslog daemon has been
started, which in turn can only happen once all the file systems have
been mounted.  The simple operating system defined earlier (@pxref{Using
the Configuration System}) results in a service graph like this:

@image{images/shepherd-graph,,5in,Typical shepherd service graph.}

You can actually generate such a graph for any operating system
definition using the @command{guix system shepherd-graph} command
(@pxref{system-shepherd-graph, @command{guix system shepherd-graph}}).

The @var{%shepherd-root-service} is a service object representing
PID@tie{}1, of type @var{shepherd-root-service-type}; it can be extended
by passing it lists of @code{<shepherd-service>} objects.

@deftp {Data Type} shepherd-service
The data type representing a service managed by the Shepherd.

@table @asis
@item @code{provision}
This is a list of symbols denoting what the service provides.

These are the names that may be passed to @command{herd start},
@command{herd status}, and similar commands (@pxref{Invoking herd,,,
shepherd, The GNU Shepherd Manual}).  @xref{Slots of services, the
@code{provides} slot,, shepherd, The GNU Shepherd Manual}, for details.

@item @code{requirements} (default: @code{'()})
List of symbols denoting the Shepherd services this one depends on.

@item @code{respawn?} (default: @code{#t})
Whether to restart the service when it stops, for instance when the
underlying process dies.

@item @code{start}
@itemx @code{stop} (default: @code{#~(const #f)})
The @code{start} and @code{stop} fields refer to the Shepherd's
facilities to start and stop processes (@pxref{Service De- and
Constructors,,, shepherd, The GNU Shepherd Manual}).  They are given as
G-expressions that get expanded in the Shepherd configuration file
(@pxref{G-Expressions}).

@item @code{actions} (default: @code{'()})
@cindex actions, of Shepherd services
This is a list of @code{shepherd-action} objects (see below) defining
@dfn{actions} supported by the service, in addition to the standard
@code{start} and @code{stop} actions.  Actions listed here become available as
@command{herd} sub-commands:

@example
herd @var{action} @var{service} [@var{arguments}@dots{}]
@end example

@item @code{documentation}
A documentation string, as shown when running:

@example
herd doc @var{service-name}
@end example

where @var{service-name} is one of the symbols in @var{provision}
(@pxref{Invoking herd,,, shepherd, The GNU Shepherd Manual}).

@item @code{modules} (default: @var{%default-modules})
This is the list of modules that must be in scope when @code{start} and
@code{stop} are evaluated.

@end table
@end deftp

@deftp {Data Type} shepherd-action
This is the data type that defines additional actions implemented by a
Shepherd service (see above).

@table @code
@item name
Symbol naming the action.

@item documentation
This is a documentation string for the action.  It can be viewed by running:

@example
herd doc @var{service} action @var{action}
@end example

@item procedure
This should be a gexp that evaluates to a procedure of at least one argument,
which is the ``running value'' of the service (@pxref{Slots of services,,,
shepherd, The GNU Shepherd Manual}).
@end table

The following example defines an action called @code{say-hello} that kindly
greets the user:

@example
(shepherd-action
  (name 'say-hello)
  (documentation "Say hi!")
  (procedure #~(lambda (running . args)
                 (format #t "Hello, friend! arguments: ~s\n"
                         args)
                 #t)))
@end example

Assuming this action is added to the @code{example} service, then you can do:

@example
# herd say-hello example
Hello, friend! arguments: ()
# herd say-hello example a b c
Hello, friend! arguments: ("a" "b" "c")
@end example

This, as you can see, is a fairly sophisticated way to say hello.
@xref{Service Convenience,,, shepherd, The GNU Shepherd Manual}, for more
info on actions.
@end deftp

@defvr {Scheme Variable} shepherd-root-service-type
The service type for the Shepherd ``root service''---i.e., PID@tie{}1.

This is the service type that extensions target when they want to create
shepherd services (@pxref{Service Types and Services}, for an example).
Each extension must pass a list of @code{<shepherd-service>}.
@end defvr

@defvr {Scheme Variable} %shepherd-root-service
This service represents PID@tie{}1.
@end defvr


@node Documentation
@chapter Documentation

@cindex documentation, searching for
@cindex searching for documentation
@cindex Info, documentation format
@cindex man pages
@cindex manual pages
In most cases packages installed with Guix come with documentation.
There are two main documentation formats: ``Info'', a browseable
hypertext format used for GNU software, and ``manual pages'' (or ``man
pages''), the linear documentation format traditionally found on Unix.
Info manuals are accessed with the @command{info} command or with Emacs,
and man pages are accessed using @command{man}.

You can look for documentation of software installed on your system by
keyword.  For example, the following command searches for information
about ``TLS'' in Info manuals:

@example
$ info -k TLS
"(emacs)Network Security" -- STARTTLS
"(emacs)Network Security" -- TLS
"(gnutls)Core TLS API" -- gnutls_certificate_set_verify_flags
"(gnutls)Core TLS API" -- gnutls_certificate_set_verify_function
@dots{}
@end example

@noindent
The command below searches for the same keyword in man pages:

@example
$ man -k TLS
SSL (7)              - OpenSSL SSL/TLS library
certtool (1)         - GnuTLS certificate tool
@dots {}
@end example

These searches are purely local to your computer so you have the
guarantee that documentation you find corresponds to what you have
actually installed, you can access it off-line, and your privacy is
respected.

Once you have these results, you can view the relevant documentation by
running, say:

@example
$ info "(gnutls)Core TLS API"
@end example

@noindent
or:

@example
$ man certtool
@end example

Info manuals contain sections and indices as well as hyperlinks like
those found in Web pages.  The @command{info} reader (@pxref{Top, Info
reader,, info-stnd, Stand-alone GNU Info}) and its Emacs counterpart
(@pxref{Misc Help,,, emacs, The GNU Emacs Manual}) provide intuitive key
bindings to navigate manuals.  @xref{Getting Started,,, info, Info: An
Introduction}, for an introduction to Info navigation.

@node Installing Debugging Files
@chapter Installing Debugging Files

@cindex debugging files
Program binaries, as produced by the GCC compilers for instance, are
typically written in the ELF format, with a section containing
@dfn{debugging information}.  Debugging information is what allows the
debugger, GDB, to map binary code to source code; it is required to
debug a compiled program in good conditions.

The problem with debugging information is that is takes up a fair amount
of disk space.  For example, debugging information for the GNU C Library
weighs in at more than 60 MiB.  Thus, as a user, keeping all the
debugging info of all the installed programs is usually not an option.
Yet, space savings should not come at the cost of an impediment to
debugging---especially in the GNU system, which should make it easier
for users to exert their computing freedom (@pxref{GNU Distribution}).

Thankfully, the GNU Binary Utilities (Binutils) and GDB provide a
mechanism that allows users to get the best of both worlds: debugging
information can be stripped from the binaries and stored in separate
files.  GDB is then able to load debugging information from those files,
when they are available (@pxref{Separate Debug Files,,, gdb, Debugging
with GDB}).

The GNU distribution takes advantage of this by storing debugging
information in the @code{lib/debug} sub-directory of a separate package
output unimaginatively called @code{debug} (@pxref{Packages with
Multiple Outputs}).  Users can choose to install the @code{debug} output
of a package when they need it.  For instance, the following command
installs the debugging information for the GNU C Library and for GNU
Guile:

@example
guix package -i glibc:debug guile:debug
@end example

GDB must then be told to look for debug files in the user's profile, by
setting the @code{debug-file-directory} variable (consider setting it
from the @file{~/.gdbinit} file, @pxref{Startup,,, gdb, Debugging with
GDB}):

@example
(gdb) set debug-file-directory ~/.guix-profile/lib/debug
@end example

From there on, GDB will pick up debugging information from the
@code{.debug} files under @file{~/.guix-profile/lib/debug}.

In addition, you will most likely want GDB to be able to show the source
code being debugged.  To do that, you will have to unpack the source
code of the package of interest (obtained with @code{guix build
--source}, @pxref{Invoking guix build}), and to point GDB to that source
directory using the @code{directory} command (@pxref{Source Path,
@code{directory},, gdb, Debugging with GDB}).

@c XXX: keep me up-to-date
The @code{debug} output mechanism in Guix is implemented by the
@code{gnu-build-system} (@pxref{Build Systems}).  Currently, it is
opt-in---debugging information is available only for the packages
with definitions explicitly declaring a @code{debug} output.  This may be
changed to opt-out in the future if our build farm servers can handle
the load.  To check whether a package has a @code{debug} output, use
@command{guix package --list-available} (@pxref{Invoking guix package}).


@node Security Updates
@chapter Security Updates

@cindex security updates
@cindex security vulnerabilities
Occasionally, important security vulnerabilities are discovered in software
packages and must be patched.  Guix developers try hard to keep track of
known vulnerabilities and to apply fixes as soon as possible in the
@code{master} branch of Guix (we do not yet provide a ``stable'' branch
containing only security updates.)  The @command{guix lint} tool helps
developers find out about vulnerable versions of software packages in the
distribution:

@smallexample
$ guix lint -c cve
gnu/packages/base.scm:652:2: glibc@@2.21: probably vulnerable to CVE-2015-1781, CVE-2015-7547
gnu/packages/gcc.scm:334:2: gcc@@4.9.3: probably vulnerable to CVE-2015-5276
gnu/packages/image.scm:312:2: openjpeg@@2.1.0: probably vulnerable to CVE-2016-1923, CVE-2016-1924
@dots{}
@end smallexample

@xref{Invoking guix lint}, for more information.

@quotation Note
As of version @value{VERSION}, the feature described below is considered
``beta''.
@end quotation

Guix follows a functional
package management discipline (@pxref{Introduction}), which implies
that, when a package is changed, @emph{every package that depends on it}
must be rebuilt.  This can significantly slow down the deployment of
fixes in core packages such as libc or Bash, since basically the whole
distribution would need to be rebuilt.  Using pre-built binaries helps
(@pxref{Substitutes}), but deployment may still take more time than
desired.

@cindex grafts
To address this, Guix implements @dfn{grafts}, a mechanism that allows
for fast deployment of critical updates without the costs associated
with a whole-distribution rebuild.  The idea is to rebuild only the
package that needs to be patched, and then to ``graft'' it onto packages
explicitly installed by the user and that were previously referring to
the original package.  The cost of grafting is typically very low, and
order of magnitudes lower than a full rebuild of the dependency chain.

@cindex replacements of packages, for grafts
For instance, suppose a security update needs to be applied to Bash.
Guix developers will provide a package definition for the ``fixed''
Bash, say @var{bash-fixed}, in the usual way (@pxref{Defining
Packages}).  Then, the original package definition is augmented with a
@code{replacement} field pointing to the package containing the bug fix:

@example
(define bash
  (package
    (name "bash")
    ;; @dots{}
    (replacement bash-fixed)))
@end example

From there on, any package depending directly or indirectly on Bash---as
reported by @command{guix gc --requisites} (@pxref{Invoking guix
gc})---that is installed is automatically ``rewritten'' to refer to
@var{bash-fixed} instead of @var{bash}.  This grafting process takes
time proportional to the size of the package, usually less than a
minute for an ``average'' package on a recent machine.  Grafting is
recursive: when an indirect dependency requires grafting, then grafting
``propagates'' up to the package that the user is installing.

Currently, the length of the name and version of the graft and that of
the package it replaces (@var{bash-fixed} and @var{bash} in the example
above) must be equal.  This restriction mostly comes from the fact that
grafting works by patching files, including binary files, directly.
Other restrictions may apply: for instance, when adding a graft to a
package providing a shared library, the original shared library and its
replacement must have the same @code{SONAME} and be binary-compatible.

The @option{--no-grafts} command-line option allows you to forcefully
avoid grafting (@pxref{Common Build Options, @option{--no-grafts}}).
Thus, the command:

@example
guix build bash --no-grafts
@end example

@noindent
returns the store file name of the original Bash, whereas:

@example
guix build bash
@end example

@noindent
returns the store file name of the ``fixed'', replacement Bash.  This
allows you to distinguish between the two variants of Bash.

To verify which Bash your whole profile refers to, you can run
(@pxref{Invoking guix gc}):

@example
guix gc -R `readlink -f ~/.guix-profile` | grep bash
@end example

@noindent
@dots{} and compare the store file names that you get with those above.
Likewise for a complete Guix system generation:

@example
guix gc -R `guix system build my-config.scm` | grep bash
@end example

Lastly, to check which Bash running processes are using, you can use the
@command{lsof} command:

@example
lsof | grep /gnu/store/.*bash
@end example


@node Bootstrapping
@chapter Bootstrapping

@c Adapted from the ELS 2013 paper.

@cindex bootstrapping

Bootstrapping in our context refers to how the distribution gets built
``from nothing''.  Remember that the build environment of a derivation
contains nothing but its declared inputs (@pxref{Introduction}).  So
there's an obvious chicken-and-egg problem: how does the first package
get built?  How does the first compiler get compiled?  Note that this is
a question of interest only to the curious hacker, not to the regular
user, so you can shamelessly skip this section if you consider yourself
a ``regular user''.

@cindex bootstrap binaries
The GNU system is primarily made of C code, with libc at its core.  The
GNU build system itself assumes the availability of a Bourne shell and
command-line tools provided by GNU Coreutils, Awk, Findutils, `sed', and
`grep'.  Furthermore, build programs---programs that run
@code{./configure}, @code{make}, etc.---are written in Guile Scheme
(@pxref{Derivations}).  Consequently, to be able to build anything at
all, from scratch, Guix relies on pre-built binaries of Guile, GCC,
Binutils, libc, and the other packages mentioned above---the
@dfn{bootstrap binaries}.

These bootstrap binaries are ``taken for granted'', though we can also
re-create them if needed (more on that later).

@unnumberedsec Preparing to Use the Bootstrap Binaries

@c As of Emacs 24.3, Info-mode displays the image, but since it's a
@c large image, it's hard to scroll.  Oh well.
@image{images/bootstrap-graph,6in,,Dependency graph of the early bootstrap derivations}

The figure above shows the very beginning of the dependency graph of the
distribution, corresponding to the package definitions of the @code{(gnu
packages bootstrap)} module.  A similar figure can be generated with
@command{guix graph} (@pxref{Invoking guix graph}), along the lines of:

@example
guix graph -t derivation \
  -e '(@@@@ (gnu packages bootstrap) %bootstrap-gcc)' \
  | dot -Tps > t.ps
@end example

At this level of detail, things are
slightly complex.  First, Guile itself consists of an ELF executable,
along with many source and compiled Scheme files that are dynamically
loaded when it runs.  This gets stored in the @file{guile-2.0.7.tar.xz}
tarball shown in this graph.  This tarball is part of Guix's ``source''
distribution, and gets inserted into the store with @code{add-to-store}
(@pxref{The Store}).

But how do we write a derivation that unpacks this tarball and adds it
to the store?  To solve this problem, the @code{guile-bootstrap-2.0.drv}
derivation---the first one that gets built---uses @code{bash} as its
builder, which runs @code{build-bootstrap-guile.sh}, which in turn calls
@code{tar} to unpack the tarball.  Thus, @file{bash}, @file{tar},
@file{xz}, and @file{mkdir} are statically-linked binaries, also part of
the Guix source distribution, whose sole purpose is to allow the Guile
tarball to be unpacked.

Once @code{guile-bootstrap-2.0.drv} is built, we have a functioning
Guile that can be used to run subsequent build programs.  Its first task
is to download tarballs containing the other pre-built binaries---this
is what the @code{.tar.xz.drv} derivations do.  Guix modules such as
@code{ftp-client.scm} are used for this purpose.  The
@code{module-import.drv} derivations import those modules in a directory
in the store, using the original layout.  The
@code{module-import-compiled.drv} derivations compile those modules, and
write them in an output directory with the right layout.  This
corresponds to the @code{#:modules} argument of
@code{build-expression->derivation} (@pxref{Derivations}).

Finally, the various tarballs are unpacked by the
derivations @code{gcc-bootstrap-0.drv}, @code{glibc-bootstrap-0.drv},
etc., at which point we have a working C tool chain.


@unnumberedsec Building the Build Tools

Bootstrapping is complete when we have a full tool chain that does not
depend on the pre-built bootstrap tools discussed above.  This
no-dependency requirement is verified by checking whether the files of
the final tool chain contain references to the @file{/gnu/store}
directories of the bootstrap inputs.  The process that leads to this
``final'' tool chain is described by the package definitions found in
the @code{(gnu packages commencement)} module.

The @command{guix graph} command allows us to ``zoom out'' compared to
the graph above, by looking at the level of package objects instead of
individual derivations---remember that a package may translate to
several derivations, typically one derivation to download its source,
one to build the Guile modules it needs, and one to actually build the
package from source.  The command:

@example
guix graph -t bag \
  -e '(@@@@ (gnu packages commencement)
          glibc-final-with-bootstrap-bash)' | dot -Tps > t.ps
@end example

@noindent
produces the dependency graph leading to the ``final'' C
library@footnote{You may notice the @code{glibc-intermediate} label,
suggesting that it is not @emph{quite} final, but as a good
approximation, we will consider it final.}, depicted below.

@image{images/bootstrap-packages,6in,,Dependency graph of the early packages}

@c See <http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/gnu-system-discuss/2012-10/msg00000.html>.
The first tool that gets built with the bootstrap binaries is
GNU@tie{}Make---noted @code{make-boot0} above---which is a prerequisite
for all the following packages.  From there Findutils and Diffutils get
built.

Then come the first-stage Binutils and GCC, built as pseudo cross
tools---i.e., with @code{--target} equal to @code{--host}.  They are
used to build libc.  Thanks to this cross-build trick, this libc is
guaranteed not to hold any reference to the initial tool chain.

From there the final Binutils and GCC (not shown above) are built.
GCC uses @code{ld}
from the final Binutils, and links programs against the just-built libc.
This tool chain is used to build the other packages used by Guix and by
the GNU Build System: Guile, Bash, Coreutils, etc.

And voilà!  At this point we have the complete set of build tools that
the GNU Build System expects.  These are in the @code{%final-inputs}
variable of the @code{(gnu packages commencement)} module, and are
implicitly used by any package that uses @code{gnu-build-system}
(@pxref{Build Systems, @code{gnu-build-system}}).


@unnumberedsec Building the Bootstrap Binaries

@cindex bootstrap binaries
Because the final tool chain does not depend on the bootstrap binaries,
those rarely need to be updated.  Nevertheless, it is useful to have an
automated way to produce them, should an update occur, and this is what
the @code{(gnu packages make-bootstrap)} module provides.

The following command builds the tarballs containing the bootstrap
binaries (Guile, Binutils, GCC, libc, and a tarball containing a mixture
of Coreutils and other basic command-line tools):

@example
guix build bootstrap-tarballs
@end example

The generated tarballs are those that should be referred to in the
@code{(gnu packages bootstrap)} module mentioned at the beginning of
this section.

Still here?  Then perhaps by now you've started to wonder: when do we
reach a fixed point?  That is an interesting question!  The answer is
unknown, but if you would like to investigate further (and have
significant computational and storage resources to do so), then let us
know.

@unnumberedsec Reducing the Set of Bootstrap Binaries

Our bootstrap binaries currently include GCC, Guile, etc.  That's a lot
of binary code!  Why is that a problem?  It's a problem because these
big chunks of binary code are practically non-auditable, which makes it
hard to establish what source code produced them.  Every unauditable
binary also leaves us vulnerable to compiler backdoors as described by
Ken Thompson in the 1984 paper @emph{Reflections on Trusting Trust}.

This is mitigated by the fact that our bootstrap binaries were generated
from an earlier Guix revision.  Nevertheless it lacks the level of
transparency that we get in the rest of the package dependency graph,
where Guix always gives us a source-to-binary mapping.  Thus, our goal
is to reduce the set of bootstrap binaries to the bare minimum.

The @uref{http://bootstrappable.org, Bootstrappable.org web site} lists
on-going projects to do that.  One of these is about replacing the
bootstrap GCC with a sequence of assemblers, interpreters, and compilers
of increasing complexity, which could be built from source starting from
a simple and auditable assembler.  Your help is welcome!


@node Porting
@chapter Porting to a New Platform

As discussed above, the GNU distribution is self-contained, and
self-containment is achieved by relying on pre-built ``bootstrap
binaries'' (@pxref{Bootstrapping}).  These binaries are specific to an
operating system kernel, CPU architecture, and application binary
interface (ABI).  Thus, to port the distribution to a platform that is
not yet supported, one must build those bootstrap binaries, and update
the @code{(gnu packages bootstrap)} module to use them on that platform.

Fortunately, Guix can @emph{cross compile} those bootstrap binaries.
When everything goes well, and assuming the GNU tool chain supports the
target platform, this can be as simple as running a command like this
one:

@example
guix build --target=armv5tel-linux-gnueabi bootstrap-tarballs
@end example

For this to work, the @code{glibc-dynamic-linker} procedure in
@code{(gnu packages bootstrap)} must be augmented to return the right
file name for libc's dynamic linker on that platform; likewise,
@code{system->linux-architecture} in @code{(gnu packages linux)} must be
taught about the new platform.

Once these are built, the @code{(gnu packages bootstrap)} module needs
to be updated to refer to these binaries on the target platform.  That
is, the hashes and URLs of the bootstrap tarballs for the new platform
must be added alongside those of the currently supported platforms.  The
bootstrap Guile tarball is treated specially: it is expected to be
available locally, and @file{gnu/local.mk} has rules to download it for
the supported architectures; a rule for the new platform must be added
as well.

In practice, there may be some complications.  First, it may be that the
extended GNU triplet that specifies an ABI (like the @code{eabi} suffix
above) is not recognized by all the GNU tools.  Typically, glibc
recognizes some of these, whereas GCC uses an extra @code{--with-abi}
configure flag (see @code{gcc.scm} for examples of how to handle this).
Second, some of the required packages could fail to build for that
platform.  Lastly, the generated binaries could be broken for some
reason.

Guix is based on the @uref{http://nixos.org/nix/, Nix package manager},
which was designed and
implemented by Eelco Dolstra, with contributions from other people (see
the @file{nix/AUTHORS} file in Guix.)  Nix pioneered functional package
management, and promoted unprecedented features, such as transactional
package upgrades and rollbacks, per-user profiles, and referentially
transparent build processes.  Without this work, Guix would not exist.

The Nix-based software distributions, Nixpkgs and NixOS, have also been
an inspiration for Guix.

GNU@tie{}Guix itself is a collective work with contributions from a
number of people.  See the @file{AUTHORS} file in Guix for more
