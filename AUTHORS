GNU Guix is consists of Scheme code that implements the deployment model
of the Nix package management tool.  In fact, it currently talks to a
build daemon whose code comes from Nix (see the manual for details.)

Nix was initially written by Eelco Dolstra; other people have been
contributing to it.  See `nix/AUTHORS' for details.

GNU Guix was initiated by Ludovic Courtès <ludo@gnu.org>, but it would
not be what it is without the contributions of the following people (in
alphabetical order):

  Andreas Enge <andreas@enge.fr>
  Nikita Karetnikov <nikita@karetnikov.org>
