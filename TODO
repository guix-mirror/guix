* integrate needed Nix code

** Remove dependency on OpenSSL

The ‘openssl’ command-line tool is used in libstore to sign store paths
to be exported, and to check such signatures.  The signing keys are
usually in /etc/nix/signing-key.{pub,sec}.  They are a PKCS#8-encoded
X.509 SubjectPublicKeyInfo.  These can be decoded with the [[http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-gnutls/2012-12/msg00012.html][C API of
GnuTLS]], but not yet with its Guile bindings.  There’s also
‘gnutls_privkey_sign_data’ to sign, and related functions.


** Add `guix publish' to publish the store using Guile's web server

Generate narinfos and nars on the fly, upon HTTP GET requests.
Ideally, extend .nix-cache-info to include the server's public key, and also
reply to requests for .narinfo.sig.
Optionally, use Guile-Avahi to publish the service.

** MAYBE Add a substituter that uses the GNUnet DHT

Would be neat if binaries could be pushed to and pulled from the GNUnet
DHT.  Guix users would sign their binaries, and define which binaries
they trust.

** Add a remote build hook

Like scripts/build-remote.pl in Nix.

* user interface
** Add a package.el (Emacs) back-end

Unfortunately package.el is monolithic, so most likely we’d have to
write a new one based on it, as opposed to actually using it.

* extend <origin>
** add OpenPGP signatures:

   (origin
     (method http-fetch)
     (uri "http://.../foo.tgz")
     (signature-uri (string-append uri ".sig"))
     (signer-openpgp-fingerprint "..."))

** allow <origin> to be a derivation/package or a file

* extend <package>

** add ‘recommends’ field

For instance, glibc, binutils, gcc, and ld-wrapper would recommend each other.
‘guix package -i’ could ask interactively (?), or allow users to follow all or
none of the recommendations.

** add a ‘user-environment-hook’

This should specify builder code to be run when building a user
environment with ‘guix-package’.  For instance, Texinfo’s hook would
create a new ‘dir’.

** add ‘patches’ there

** extend ‘propagated-build-inputs’ with support for multiple outputs

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
  (outputs '("out" "include"))
  (propagated-build-inputs
    `(((("i1" ,p1 "o1")
        ("i2" ,p2))
       => "include")
      ("i3" ,p3)))
#+END_SRC

* synchronize package descriptions with GSRC and/or the [[http://directory.fsf.org][FSD]]

Meta-data for GNU packages, including descriptions and synopses, can be
dumped from the FSD:
http://directory.fsf.org/wiki?title=GNU/Export&action=purge .
We could periodically synchronize with that.

* support cross-compilation

Implement ‘package-cross-derivation’, and add the corresponding code in
‘gnu-build-system’.  Then, actually bootstrap a cross-compilation
environment–e.g., a cross-GNU environment.

* add a guildhall build system

The Guildhall is Guile’s packaging system.  It should be easy to add a
‘guildhall-build-system’ that does the right thing based on guildhall
recipes.

* gnu-build-system: produce a ‘debug’ derivation

Set a .gnu_debuglink in the main derivations to point to the sibling
file name (only the basename, to not retain a dependency on the ‘debug’
derivation.)

For /nix/store/xyz-foobar/bin/foo, we should have
/nix/store/abc-foobar-debug/lib/nix/store/xyz-foobar/bin/foo.debug (info
"(gdb) Separate Debug Files").

Users should have a default GDB setting with ~/.guix-profile/lib/debug
as their ‘debug-file-directory’.

* build-expression->derivation: define `%system' in the builder

Would allow build expressions to have system-dependent code, like
`glibc-dynamic-linker'.

* add ‘allowed-references’ in <package>

[[file:~/src/nix/src/libstore/build.cc::if%20(drv.env.find("allowedReferences")%20!%3D%20drv.env.end())%20{][See how Nix implements that internally]].

* union

Support sophisticated collision handling when building a union: check
whether the colliding files are identical, honor per-package priorities,
etc.

* guix package

** add ‘--list-generations’, and ‘--delete-generations’

* guix build utils
** MAYBE Change ‘ld-wrapper’ to add RPATH for libs passed by file name

** MAYBE Add equivalent to chrpath that uses [[https://gitorious.org/guile-dlhacks/guile-dlhacks/][guile-dlhacks]]

** MAYBE Add a hash-rewriting thing for deep dependency replacement without rebuild

See [[https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/commit/d1662d715514e6ef9d3dc29f132f1b3d8e608a18][Shea Levy's `replace-dependency' in Nixpkgs]].

* distro
** port to new GNU/Linux platforms, notably ‘mipsel64-linux’
** port to GNU/Hurd, aka. ‘i686-gnu’

Problems include that current glibc releases do not build on GNU/Hurd.
In addition, there haven’t been stable releases of GNU Mach, MiG, and
Hurd, which would be a pre-condition.

** make a bootable GNU/Linux-Libre distro, with OS configuration EDSL

Similar in spirit to /etc/nixos/configuration.nix.
